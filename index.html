		<p>One fine day in the late 90s, a psychologist snaps at his young daughter.</p>
		<p>She snaps back.</p>
		<p>From this moment sprouts <b>an entirely new field of psychology.</b> A field unlike anything before it.</p>
		<p>As you read this, hundreds of psychologists around the world are hard at work in this new field: conspiring to unlock the secrets of what makes us <b>happy, healthy, creative, and resilient.</b></p>
		<p>What they're discovering will quietly <b>shape the future of humanity.</b></p>

		<p>Back to the grumpy psychologist and his daughter.</p>
		<p>His name is Martin Seligman. And when he snaps at his daughter, she hits him with a retort that sends all of psychology realing:</p>
		<p>"Daddy, stop being so grumpy. I used to be a whiney baby, but I learned to handle myself. <b>So you learn to be less grumpy, too.</b>" </p>
		<p>Mindflowing, right? Yeah, not so much...</p>
		<p>To understand why this was so world-shaking for Martin Seligman, realize that up to now he's spent his life studying people who feel depressed, fearful, and helpless.</p>
		<p>Cheery stuff, right?</p>
		<p>I mean, imagine the the rush of purpose and joy Seligman must have felt when he published his big paper, <i><b>"Chronic fear produced by unpredictable electric shock."</b></i></p>
		<p>But this focus on human disfunction isn't surprising: <i><b>up until now,psychology essentially comprised of trying to diagnose and fix super messed up people.</b></i></p>
		<p>So it's no surprise Martin Seligman ran around electricuting people into chronic fear.</p>
		<p>But it got more depressing. Seligman started to realize that people weren't just <i>inflicted</i> with bad psychology:
			<b>actually, otherwise healthy people were actively learning behaviors which steam rolled their own mental health.</b>
		</p>
		<p>Enter Seligman's no-nonsense daughter.</p>
		<p>Her retort sent him in a new direction:
			<b>if he'd uncovered ways people learned to wreck their mind,
				<i>could he discover ways that people could learn to build happier, healthier minds?</i>
			</b>
		</p>
		<p>Oh, yeah, and then he got elected president of the American Psychological Association.</p>
		<p>Things were about to change...</p>
