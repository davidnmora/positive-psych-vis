# positive-psych-vis
Understanding of how positive psychology's research papers, authors, and applications fit together remains trapped inside the minds of experts â€” how do we give novices that sort of perspective on the field's "knowledge landscape"?

## How to use:
Download repo, then 
```
cd ~/Downloads/positive-psych-vis
```
or into wherever you've downloaded it.
Because it relies on requests for JSON files, you've got to launch a local server. Type into the terminal:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```
then open your fave browser and find it served to
```
localhost:8000
```
You're jamming!
