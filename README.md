# positive-psych-vis
Understanding of how positive psychology's research papers, authors, and applications fit together remains trapped inside the minds of experts â€” how do we give novices that sort of perspective on the field's "knowledge landscape"?

This project visualizes the citation network 19 of positive psychology's most important authors interactively over time, showing all the papers they've written, and drawing links between papers who were highly influential on each other.

## How to use:
Download repo, then 
```
cd ~/Downloads/positive-psych-vis
```
or into wherever you've downloaded it.
Because it relies on requests for JSON files, you've got to launch a local server. Type into the terminal:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```
then open your fave browser and find it served to
```
localhost:8000
```
You're jamming!
