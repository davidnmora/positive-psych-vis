This role may be increasingly important as cognition declines. This study aimed to 1) examine the role of caregivers in medication adherence in a complex population of older home care clients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 2) examine the effect of caregiver stress on medication non-adherence.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe interRAI Resident Assessment Instrument - Home Care (RAIHC) instrument collects comprehensive information about all individuals receiving long-term home care services in the Canadian province of Ontario. This analysis of secondary data utilized this database to examine the relationship between caregiver residence and stress on medication adherence among a subset of clients with MCI who were over age 75.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe prevalence of HF among the sample was 15.5%, while MCI was present in 42.3% of the sample. Among individuals with MCI, having a caregiver at the same residence reduced medication non-adherence. Additionally, caregiver stress was significantly associated with higher rates of non-adherence.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMCI can impair medication adherence. The presence of a caregiver at home significantly improves medication adherence in patients with HF and MCI. Supporting caregivers is an important strategy in allowing clinically complex older adults to remain safely at home.", "journalVolume": "24 6", "journalName": "Aging clinical and experimental research", "year": 2012, "title": "Caregiver status affects medication adherence among older home care clients with heart failure.", "venue": "Aging clinical and experimental research", "journalPages": "718-21", "authors": [{"ids": ["4888852"], "name": "Andrea D.

Examples include such manufacturing tasks as assembly, disassembly, inspection, and materials handing. Especially in the case of humanoid robots, grasping slippery or flexible objects is required in living environments for human beings in contrast to industrial robots that handle standardized objects in controlled environments. Since the three-axis tactile sensor is effective in such cases, its importance will increase with improvements in humanoid robots. A hemispherical tactile sensor is developed for general-purpose use with our three-axis tactile sensor that is mounted on the fingertips of a multi-fingered hand. The present threeaxis tactile sensor is comprised of an acrylic dome, a light source, an optical fiber scope, and a CCD camera. The light emitted from the light source is directed onto the edge of the hemispherical acrylic dome through optical fibers. The sensing elements are concentrically arranged on the acrylic dome. In the following sections, after conventional tactile sensors are summarized to compare the present tactile sensor\u2019s merits and demerits with conventional tactile sensors,\u2019 the principle of the three-axis tactile sensor is described. Then the basic sensing characteristics are examined for evaluating the present tactile sensor.

Understand the reasoning behind obtaining a thorough medical history from abdominoplasty patients and determine how that information (e.g., history of massive weight loss, prior operations with abdominal scars) may affect the surgical plan. 2. Understand the thromboembolic risks associated with abdominoplasty patients, especially when abdominoplasty is performed in conjunction with other surgical procedures, and appropriate and currently accepted prophylaxis. 3. Describe the indications and potential risks of performing liposuction as an adjunct to abdominoplasty. 4. Evaluate a patient's abdomen, taking into consideration all the aesthetic subunits of the trunk and lower body, and determine the appropriate type of abdominoplasty indicated. 5. Identify and understand the treatment of early and late complications associated with abdominoplasty.\n\n\nSUMMARY\nIn this article, the authors review the preoperative assessment, surgical treatment plan, and outcomes of abdominoplasty. Preoperative assessment emphasizes obtaining an accurate and detailed medical history, conducting a thorough physical examination, and determining suitable and safe anesthetic options in appropriate surgical facilities. Preoperative planning stresses measures taken to minimize perioperative complications, and intraoperative planning reviews the various surgical techniques. Postoperative complications and their treatments are discussed, as well as the safety of combining abdominoplasty with other procedures. Current procedural terminology is also reported, since there have been recent changes to those codes commonly used in abdominoplasty.", "journalVolume": "121 4 Suppl", "journalName": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "year": 2008, "title": "MOC-PS(SM) CME article: abdominoplasty.", "venue": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "journalPages": "1-11", "authors": [{"ids": ["13383038"], "name": "Jack A.

The mortality is still 60%. 75% of the patients have no risk factors for colorectal cancer, 18% have a positive family history for the disease. In these patients colorectal cancer arise from benign adenomatous polyps. A 76-90% reduction in colorectal cancer incidence can be achieved by endoscopic polypectomy. Tumor stage is an important determinant of outcome. In Dukes stage A the overall survival rate is over 90%. By annual fecal occult blood test the incidence and mortality rate of colorectal cancer can be reduced significantly. The combination of fecal occult blood test and flexible sigmoidoscopy seems to be more effective. An alternative strategy is a colonoscopy every ten years. But the important problem in Germany is the very low compliance of the patients.

We identify the minimal ribozyme by deletion analysis applying a new RNase R based assay for the branching reaction, and by mutational analysis we demonstrate a surprising effect on the activity of structural elements J2/10 and L9 located outside the core of the ribozyme.

Ages ranged from 21 days to 7.2 years (median, 62 days) and weights from 1.8 to 21.5 kg (median, 3.4 kg). Ten patients were operated on before 1 month of age, 20 between 1 and 3 months, 13 between 3 months and 1 year, and 3 at an older age. Associated cardiac conditions were encountered frequently, the most common being coronary artery anomalies (n = 16), truncal valve incompetence (n = 12), and interrupted aortic arch (n = 5). The right ventricular outflow tract was reconstructed with an aortic (n = 28) or a pulmonary homograft (n = 18).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were two hospital deaths (4.3%). Both patients had severe truncal valve regurgitation and interrupted aortic arch together with other unfavorable conditions. Survival in uncomplicated truncus arteriosus was 100%. Follow-up was from 3 months to 10 years (mean, 36 months). There was one late death 4 months after the initial repair, presumably because of cardiac reason. Actuarial survival was 93% at 4 months and beyond. Actuarial freedom of reoperation in the 27 hospital survivors with aortic homografts was 43% at 75 months; it was 73% at 62 months in the 17 patients surviving with pulmonary homografts.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nNeonatal or early infancy complete repair is the treatment with the best potential for survival. The homograft remains our conduit of choice to establish continuity between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery.

We show that an optimal policy exists and suggest a value iteration algorithm to compute it. Since in general this algorithm is computationally very intensive, we also consider a \u201cgreedy\u201d solution that scales well with the dimension of the problem.

In this demonstration, AFit shows that it is possible to adaptively select the device to track the user movement for fitness tracking, rather than using randomly selected device or all devices, utilizing the common sensor of accelerometer on all devices.", "journalVolume": "", "journalName": "", "year": 2016, "title": "AFit: adaptive fitness tracking by application function virtualization", "venue": "UbiComp Adjunct", "journalPages": "309-312", "authors": [{"ids": ["3134176"], "name": "Harini Kolamunna"}, {"ids": ["2262652"], "name": "Yining Hu"}, {"ids": ["1768263"], "name": "Diego Perino"}, {"ids": ["3259713"], "name": "Kanchana Thilakarathna"}, {"ids": ["2678854"], "name": "Dwight J.

The hot spot activity associated with the HIS4 gene requires the Bas1p transcription factor. To determine whether this relationship between transcription factor binding and hot spot activity is general, we used DNA microarrays to map all genomic Bas1p binding sites and to map the frequency of meiosis-specific double-strand DNA breaks (as an estimate of the recombination activity) of all genes in both wild-type and bas1 strains. We identified sites of Bas1p-DNA interactions upstream of 71 genes, many of which are involved in histidine and purine biosynthesis. Our analysis of recombination activity in wild-type and bas1 strains showed that the recombination activities of some genes with Bas1p binding sites were dependent on Bas1p (as observed for HIS4), whereas the activities of other genes with Bas1p binding sites were unaffected or were repressed by Bas1p. These data demonstrate that the effect of transcription factors on meiotic recombination activity is strongly context dependent. In wild-type and bas1 strains, meiotic recombination was strongly suppressed in large (25- to 150-kb) chromosomal regions near the telomeres and centromeres and in the region flanking the rRNA genes. These results argue that both local and regional factors affect the level of meiotic recombination.", "journalVolume": "26 3", "journalName": "Molecular and cellular biology", "year": 2006, "title": "Global analysis of the relationship between the binding of the Bas1p transcription factor and meiosis-specific double-strand DNA breaks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.", "venue": "Molecular and cellular biology", "journalPages": "1014-27", "authors": [{"ids": ["3665413"], "name": "Piotr A.

The present study assessed the effects and mechanisms of action of advanced glycation end products\u00a0(AGEs), which play an important role in the development of diabetes complications, on testosterone secretion by rat Leydig cells. Primary rat Leydig cells were cultured and treated with AGEs\u00a0(25, 50, 100 and\u00a0200\u00a0\u00b5g/ml). Testosterone production induced by human chorionic gonadotropin\u00a0(hCG) was determined by ELISA. The mRNA and protein expression levels of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein\u00a0(StAR), cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme\u00a0(P450scc) and 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase\u00a0(3\u03b2-HSD), which are involved in testosterone biosynthesis, were measured by reverse transcription-quantitative\u00a0PCR and western blot analyssi, respectively. Reactive oxygen species\u00a0(ROS) production in Leydig cells was measured using the dichlorofluorescein diacetate\u00a0(DCFH-DA) probe. The expression levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related proteins\u00a0[C/EBP homologous protein\u00a0(CHOP)\u00a0and\u00a0glucose-regulated protein\u00a078\u00a0(GRP78)] in the Leydig cells were measured by western blot analysis. We found that the AGEs markedly suppressed testosterone production by rat Leydig cells which was induced by hCG in a concentration-dependent manner compared with the control\u00a0(P<0.01). The mRNA and protein expression levels of StAR, 3\u03b2-HSD and P450scc were downregulated by the AGEs in a dose-dependent manner compared with the control\u00a0(P<0.01). The antioxidant agent, N-acetyl\u2011L\u2011cysteine\u00a0(NAC), and the endoplasmic reticulum stress inhibitor, tauroursodeoxycholic acid\u00a0(TUDCA), reversed the inhibitory effects of AGEs. In addition, the content of ROS in Leydig cells treated with AGEs increased significantly. The expression levels of CHOP and GRP78 were markedly upregulated by the AGEs in the Leydig cells. From these findings, it can be concluded that AGEs inhibit testosterone production by rat Leydig cells by inducing oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress.", "journalVolume": "38 2", "journalName": "International journal of molecular medicine", "year": 2016, "title": "Advanced glycation end products inhibit testosterone secretion by rat Leydig cells by inducing oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress.", "venue": "International journal of molecular medicine", "journalPages": "659-65", "authors": [{"ids": ["14682081"], "name": "Yun-tao Zhao"}, {"ids": ["8765885"], "name": "Ya-wei Qi"}, {"ids": ["13302195"], "name": "Chuan-Yin Hu"}, {"ids": ["7159869"], "name": "Shao-hong Chen"}, {"ids": ["14772389"], "name": "You Liu"}], "inCitations": ["636e0f191d8096979bedd153414b95fe77e77b6a"], "keyPhrases": [], "id": "000bdd95d182f19310214e9ec04e783be9dea111"}, {"outCitations": ["d27ff545505a1fdfce8d97a05ba05ba7c7ca3715", "e3fb8a90772396302d5b5393007cf054a8471cc8", "46c1a5a1e4a7a58220361aa79767f54ac04bb2eb", "28c366322dd99db62544b1f81cf2b8b689005a9e", "0a32f32c1d4f9d92e955d7b26df024acf3c93762", "7f81358a7ba50287a12b87e6b2a48ba58b6b7827"], "pdfUrls": ["http://stroke.ahajournals.org/content/strokeaha/25/12/2435.full.pdf", "http://stroke.ahajournals.org/content/strokeaha/25/12/2435.full.pdf?download=true"], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/000c89649c08d3413e18f9d6a41dbae4d940ee6d", "paperAbstract": "Background and Purpose There is confusion about how carotid stenosis should be measured on angiograms.

In striking contrast, the mutants did not affect virion infectivity, during which time the gp41 protein is embedded in the HIV envelope membrane. To examine the role of LLP2/membrane interactions, we applied synchrotron x-radiation to determine structure of hydrated membranes. We focused on WT LLP2 peptide (+3 charge) and MX2 mutant (-1 charge) with membrane mimics for the T-cell and the HIV-1 membranes. To investigate the influence of electrostatics, cholesterol content, and peptide palmitoylation, we also studied three other LLP2 variants and HIV-1 mimics without negatively charged lipids or cholesterol as well as extracted HIV-1 lipids. All LLP2 peptides bound strongly to T-cell membrane mimics, as indicated by changes in membrane structure and bending. In contrast, none of the weakly bound LLP2 variants changed the HIV-1 membrane mimic structure or properties. This correlates well with, and provides a biophysical basis for, previously published results that reported lack of a mutant effect in HIV virion infectivity in contrast to an inhibitory effect in T-cell syncytium formation. It shows that interaction of LLP2 with the T-cell membrane modulates biological function.", "journalVolume": "105 3", "journalName": "Biophysical journal", "year": 2013, "title": "Membrane structure correlates to function of LLP2 on the cytoplasmic tail of HIV-1 gp41 protein.", "venue": "Biophysical journal", "journalPages": "657-66", "authors": [{"ids": ["4080863"], "name": "Alexander L Boscia"}, {"ids": ["5617407"], "name": "Kiyotaka Akabori"}, {"ids": ["4327363"], "name": "Zachary Benamram"}, {"ids": ["3201842"], "name": "Jonathan A Michel"}, {"ids": ["6359088"], "name": "Michael Stephen Jablin"}, {"ids": ["4464628"], "name": "Jonathan D.

Theory suggests that among a suite of potential displays, animals will emphasize traits that are most conspicuous, least costly, or best signal condition and reduce display of other traits. Here we examined the relationship between song and plumage elaborations in cardueline finches, songbirds that are highly variable in plumage displays and songs, but that share a similar mating system. We statistically controlled for body mass, habitat characteristics, and phylogenetic relationships and found that across species song complexity was strongly negatively related to elaboration of plumage ornamentation. When plumage coloration was partitioned into carotenoid-based and melanin-based components, song complexity was negatively related to elaboration of male carotenoid-based coloration but unrelated to elaboration of melanin-based coloration. These observations support the idea that, for condition-dependent traits, animal species trade off trait expression in response to changes in the costs or the information content of these traits. We discuss several alternative explanations for the observed pattern.", "journalVolume": "56 2", "journalName": "Evolution; international journal of organic evolution", "year": 2002, "title": "Species divergence in sexually selected traits: increase in song elaboration is related to decrease in plumage ornamentation in finches.", "venue": "Evolution; international journal of organic evolution", "journalPages": "412-9", "authors": [{"ids": ["4080469"], "name": "Alexander V.

Such videos can greatly benefit from automatically distinguishing between social media content that is about someone\u2019s own wedding from that week, to an old wedding, or to that of a friend. In this paper, we describe our approach for identifying a number of common personal life events from social media content (in this paper we have used Twitter for our test), using multiple feature-based classifiers. Results show that combination of linguistic and social interaction features increases overall classification accuracy of most of the events while some events are relatively more difficult than others (e.g. new born with mean precision of .6 from all three models).", "journalVolume": "", "journalName": "", "year": 2014, "title": "Personal Life Event Detection from Social Media", "venue": "HT", "journalPages": "", "authors": [{"ids": ["2644710"], "name": "Smitashree Choudhury"}, {"ids": ["2798006"], "name": "Harith Alani"}], "inCitations": ["0f833d7b07123058cae4dc2563221975090b1220", "2998ca9cd701a176b02d15c909e86fba66a5988f", "8c24d85c943f240f3c4137b5431cdd6b0988b4b4", "7e5f2f44b77bd7e16ed7cf1883cf8f7851fe8db7", "369d95d79c3d8e155f7c04230e1527abbf807b8f", "c0c8d00d6ae2f6eb0ce87cd437d61a6a23e22419"], "keyPhrases": ["Social Media", "Life Event", "Movie", "Photo", "Formance", "Main Body", "Tweet", "Research Topic"], "id": "0011831d6d86f54148cd0ee1d280ad7b160498ba"}, {"outCitations": ["4fcdaef2de32fcab5e0c7c61e6b4e73a6c708083", "cd24f854b7d4f49d0b4e64979846ebdc3a236108", "6bb1754e7838747a99fb663f36104ab816bd00b7", "37b3ea31ee9f3f2bccb9f9fb67a0fc6ba386b0ba", "14076b18cfe4c682470a5b1d70b10d061d2ebdb3", "946b9f1cf77753c3255111467d092560fc35a6ca", "a076084ba0c67a8f0f1ac27da628645f7cc8dc34", "5cee6cd7aab6b08aad3457c372cfae6ca5c868df", "008c8acbe84c6cbc0c75911dd7e16b389a40fc3f", "0df965399dff813db8c60925afff24ac849138e8", "492185cb4c3e0a1e0a0a15ad9e82d1bf5c56af96", "330bbbed565caec79533390267c8910e1900c716", "6c4c0155fada817bde95660411d516c0927ffffe", "d2c6b38f45d93951931919325ef316d1911d73e3", "75adbde8b521cc7897f952f57a4f726aebe37879", "885fdb54e9053327823629a6d9afcd58e4a5ce4b", "f87c5cf4d582b156294d7fddbed61f09d60e09c9", "067a8926d5333a38fd76298deb666330ae770572", "ad292bbb5dd86564ae082dea03f672d245a23953", "885265dedc9d3f28070b91d2c7fe99f363179824"], "pdfUrls": ["http://dev.biologists.org/content/develop/113/4/1405.full.pdf"], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0011a20b1e3fa3333042a943e513f81cf6cbc2e4", "paperAbstract": "The vitamin A derivative retinoic acid has previously been shown to have teratogenic effects on heart development in mammalian embryos. The craniomedial migration of the precardiac mesoderm during the early stages of heart formation is thought to depend on a gradient of extracellular fibronectin associated with the underlying endoderm. Here, the effects of retinoic acid on migration of the precardiac mesoderm have been investigated in the early chick embryo. When applied to the whole embryo in culture, the retinoid inhibits the craniomedial migration of the precardiac mesoderm resulting in a heart tube that is stunted cranially, while normal or enlarged caudally. Similarly, a local application of retinoic acid to the heart-forming area disrupts the formation of the cardiogenic crescent and the subsequent development of a single mid-line heart tube. This effect is analogous to removing a segment of endoderm and mesoderm across the heart-forming area and results in various degrees of cardia bifida. At higher concentrations of retinoic acid and earlier developmental stages, two completely separate hearts are produced, while at lower concentrations and later stages there are partial bifurcations. The controls, in which the identical operation is carried out except that dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) is used instead of the retinoid, are almost all normal. We propose that one of the teratogenic effects of retinoic acid on the heart is to disrupt the interaction between precardiac cells and the extracellular matrix thus inhibiting their directed migration on the endodermal substratum.", "journalVolume": "113 4", "journalName": "Development", "year": 1991, "title": "The effects of retinoic acid on heart formation in the early chick embryo.", "venue": "Development", "journalPages": "1405-17", "authors": [{"ids": ["14910402"], "name": "Mark K Osmond"}, {"ids": ["20120277"], "name": "Arlene Butler"}, {"ids": ["7996135"], "name": "Frank C.

We have shown that the expression level of GRK2 in lymphocytes decreases during inflammatory diseases such as arthritis. Reactive oxygen species play an important role in a variety of inflammatory conditions, including arthritis. We demonstrate herein that oxidative stress, induced by exposure of lymphocytes to H(2)O(2), results in a 50% reduction in GRK2 protein levels and GRK activity with no changes in mRNA expression. Treatment of lymphocytes with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein partially reverses the effect of H(2)O(2) on GRK2 levels, although we did not detect direct tyrosine phosphorylation of GRK2. Inhibition of the nonproteasomal protease calpain by calpeptin can prevent the H(2)O(2)-induced GRK2 decrease. In vitro experiments confirm that GRK2 is partially digested by m-calpain in a calcium-dependent way. Functionally, H(2)O(2)-induced decrease in GRK2 levels is associated with an ~70% decrease in agonist-induced beta(2)-adrenergic receptor sequestration. We describe oxidative stress as a novel mechanism for regulation of the intracellular level of GRK2 during inflammatory processes. Moreover, our data demonstrate that oxidative stress may change the functioning of GPCRs via calpain-dependent regulation of GRK2 levels.", "journalVolume": "62 2", "journalName": "Molecular pharmacology", "year": 2002, "title": "Oxidative stress decreases G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 in lymphocytes via a calpain-dependent mechanism.", "venue": "Molecular pharmacology", "journalPages": "379-88", "authors": [{"ids": ["5506397"], "name": "Maria Stella Lombardi"}, {"ids": ["2074386"], "name": "Annemieke Kavelaars"}, {"ids": ["10274154"], "name": "Petronila Penela"}, {"ids": ["1925095"], "name": "Elisabeth J Scholtens"}, {"ids": ["5631186"], "name": "Marta Roccio"}, {"ids": ["1735873"], "name": "Reinhold Schmidt"}, {"ids": ["3283241"], "name": "Manfred Schedlowski"}, {"ids": ["4500713"], "name": "Federico Mayor"}, {"ids": ["2517364"], "name": "Cobi J Heijnen"}], "inCitations": ["efe3c1499f11a8994d1bad81f9061b5eddb3732e", "0c8dab981a01befb15a74c435ebcccd0f8316de2", "e51237e17e436732d70d6ff4c50a074161512d0a", "49cb771ef644cc9f7b900deaa6761bb0b0263899", "a6a622805b1b5620de04158737f8979f8e875862", "bb228fe736ec2d54ff43a5b32637ab88d20986a3", "4d47b18aaaffef9459e2bab714a30bbe8ba3f266", "28d91c043dba9f845d95692548fce25226b0efaa", "eb6954479a4835bddfec5385715bed29ae8608df", "56a98d415a52893a9311de921f3332a4d5983f86", "3ce438507cbed94f810e122123e2c553c60ab9b2", "760c7d5c7f48a75ebe79b6b35c19572c4cef43c9", "3e5d4ae0dd54358b164a373a09430c6ccbb86965", "3e6afe4b9db1f4b4ff1793a07addfc88b9c22038", "a5fc1852161379bf273bb5dedb0223c1f5600c09"], "keyPhrases": [], "id": "001721c81562e6dbcc51f9e98d98354d9e1a3260"}, {"outCitations": [], "pdfUrls": [], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0017a81f70cc976ef30e8d3844017ffeb16078ee", "paperAbstract": "The effects of low doses of environmental ionizing radiation on reproductive functions of seven generations of CC57W/Mv mice from Chernobyl experimental population has been investigated.

Despite the fact that these mice prime CD4 + T cells (Ronchese, F., B. Housemann, S. Hubele, and P. Lane. 1994. J. Exp. Med. 179:809), antibody responses to T-dependent antigens are severely impaired. In contrast, T-independent responses are normal which suggests mCTLA4-H'y1 does not act directly on B cells, but acts indirectly by impairing T cell help. The impaired antibody defect is associated with impaired class switching, with low total immunoglobulin (Ig)G and antigen-specific IgG responses, and an absence of germinal center formation in spleen and lymph nodes but not gut-associated tissues. The defective germinal center formation is associated with a reduction in the degree of somatic mutation in hybridomas made from transgenic mice in comparison with those made from normal mice.

Only recently, with the availability of transgenic animals and gene transfer, has it become possible to overexpress the gene encoding HSP70 to test directly the hypothesis that stress proteins protect cells from injury.

The different commercial types of metals used included five cobalt-chromium alloys, pure titanium, one titanium alloy (Ti-6A1-4V) and one gold alloy (type IV) that was either unhardened or age-hardened (n = 5 per group). The test method used was a constant-deflection fatigue test in which the force required to deflect the clasp for 0.6 mm and the number of loading cycles required to fracture the clasp were determined. The fatigue fracture surface of the clasps was examined with a scanning electron microscope. The results revealed that a fatigue fracture occurred in the cobalt-chromium clasp after approximately 25,000 loading cycles, in the pure titanium clasps after 4500 loading cycles, in the titanium alloy clasp after 20,000 loading cycles, and in the gold alloy clasp after 21,000 loading cycles. The means differed significantly (p < 0.001). Activation of the clasp by bending it 0.5 mm increased the fatigue resistance of the cobalt-chromium alloy and gold alloy clasps but decreased the fatigue resistance of both pure titanium and titanium alloy clasps (p < 0.005). The results of this study suggest that significant differences exist in the fatigue resistance of removable denture clasps made from different commercial cast metals, which may cause loss of retention of the removable partial denture and clasp failures.", "journalVolume": "74 4", "journalName": "The Journal of prosthetic dentistry", "year": 1995, "title": "Deflection fatigue of cobalt-chromium, titanium, and gold alloy cast denture clasp.", "venue": "The Journal of prosthetic dentistry", "journalPages": "412-9", "authors": [{"ids": ["21494206"], "name": "PK Vallittu"}, {"ids": ["2726628"], "name": "Meri Kokkonen"}], "inCitations": ["bc4d06ae60adec81951da0aec2d4e51193070351", "d9053fe99e35d2de233e3475d3c213d76d65b355", "75d92de3a1617c34dd8837a631c35d3bfe6f7745", "e687a81e924cf14fcabe9716ac6a1bcc1d1ec0a8", "e16254e1541b2944e46a75000262fd16919c3a4a", "7b5d26960913a82b6c5d9a31a5445f9682ae91f3", "be92e21120eaedbb62027214a7d22d597b7606ba", "818c156e3387f6c3ea6a8417dbaffa6ba5022fc3", "1661f7aba972399440c13b1dc32adb364951ca84", "193279f604b4112ed46317ace31c95dfa57c9ead", "6eea21cc99e4924bf04ad46bc9a5e1bf7c9f3c17", "51e6c5709def3e62c4e738240e50d2e89138b085", "91b6e86471b754e5eb65f73f5a9aeaf445d7a8b3", "0f3e28f69720c43d8b28d10f01b7e3b057ae1fe2", "db8c3b67596647906a138d67f44b1e48bee38992", "bbe8ec95e979e9283aedcea391a567274a8a2176", "a517206245b527490eee25652ec9a11e032c5ede", "7aa7da32576b358c69421c75dd269323d251ac19"], "keyPhrases": [], "id": "00196d64d8b85d92056ff73122d22c426fed83c4"}, {"outCitations": ["19109b9b7fbc190609231e38d59c78d4b828a552", "5d48d77b5e764ca1aa614408eb04c1d0f7de2f99", "5b01bde183d1b8c6c20a8ce0f010763548e83008", "807f00c01bfdf4300c33c28eaa03617ead19032f", "c610c079a20f8e601b7a75aa6be0c5c2e852a090", "6d4ba8318a528c63a47c99e1acf554416a157b64", "cd1ebffd145fb0f36c0e2014dd885d261f91af60", "37e94262427cfb4a3dfc38ca1af6c57da43a7dc4", "e4dfaa34828712b68fcc7e2f48c3e6ee7f7f92c9", "df4792955ce0784b44a0eb9c6d9e083d79886651", "e75ad5172ab26968ef4fe3a17a257fe503670652", "2e76083332c1185f7880cbabf3fae2cf195d7e91"], "pdfUrls": ["https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2010.5575211"], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00199a56600917b0fbc865a992f051b294bfc691", "paperAbstract": "In developing a Virtual Reality simulation for learning breast palpation, one of critical aspects is real-time visualization of breast phantom deformation during palpation.

For visual perception of breast phantom deformation, we used a real-time model with an inside pressure to keep the volume of the breast phantom constant. On a meshed breast phantom, we compared the displacements of vertices governed by the real-time model with those governed by its FEM counterpart for four different distributions of contact force. To satisfy visual perception of breast phantom deformation, we examined the comparison by utilizing the statistical methods of ANOVA and Bland and Altman agreement.

The model uses pressure and flow measurements to estimate time-dependent resistance and elasticity factor. The model includes a resistance that has a function of the cross-section and urethral elasticity. Two resistivity types are compared in the constricted flow-controlling zone of the urethra: Poiseouille resistance and the Bernoulli effect. Using real pressure-flow data sets, the model was used to estimate urethral resistance and changes in urethral elasticity during voiding. Estimation of the elasticity show that in a normal patient relaxation of the urethra is a process that continues until the end of voiding. This has important implications with regard to the present methods that are used in the clinic to assess urethral obstruction or constriction. The resistance as calculated by this model, may be a useful indicator of urethral constriction and obstruction, since it is especially independent of the bladder function.

The method may be viewed as an approach to solve the original nonlinear Kohn-Sham equation by a nonlinear subspace iteration technique, without emphasizing the intermediate linearized Kohn-Sham eigenvalue problems. It reaches self-consistency within a similar number of SCF iterations as eigensolver-based approaches. However, replacing the standard diagonalization at each SCF iteration by a Chebyshev subspace filtering step results in a significant speedup over methods based on standard diagonalization.

We assessed the predictive value of sST2 levels in an unselected 'real-world' cohort of anticoagulated AF patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe included 562 patients (49% male; median age 77 [IQR: 71-82]) with permanent AF who were stable (for at least 6 months) on OAC (INRs 2.0-3.0). sST2 levels were quantified by ELISA.

CT-1 stimulates proatherogenic molecule expression in human vascular endothelial cells and monocyte migration. However, it has not been reported whether CT-1 accelerates atherosclerosis. This study was performed to examine the stimulatory effects of CT-1 on human macrophage foam cell formation and vascular smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation in vitro, and on the development of atherosclerotic lesions in apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice in vivo. CT-1 was expressed at high levels in endothelial cells and macrophages in both humans and ApoE(-/-) mice. CT-1 significantly enhanced oxidized low-density lipoprotein-induced foam cell formation associated with increased levels of CD36 and acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase-1 expression in human monocyte-derived macrophages. CT-1 significantly stimulated the migration, proliferation, and collagen-1 expression in human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells. Four-week infusion of CT-1 into ApoE(-/-) mice significantly accelerated the development of aortic atherosclerotic lesions with increased monocyte/macrophage infiltration, vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, and collagen-1 content in the aortic wall. Activation of inflammasome, such as apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain, nuclear factor \u03baB, and cyclooxygenase-2, was observed in exudate peritoneal macrophages from ApoE(-/-) mice infused with CT-1. Infusion of anti-CT-1-neutralizing antibody alone into ApoE(-/-) mice significantly suppressed monocyte/macrophage infiltration in atherosclerotic lesions. These results indicate that CT-1 accelerates the development of atherosclerotic lesions by stimulating the inflammasome, foam cell formation associated with CD36 and acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase-1 upregulation in macrophages, and migration, proliferation, and collagen-1 production in vascular smooth muscle cells.", "journalVolume": "62 5", "journalName": "Hypertension", "year": 2013, "title": "Stimulatory effects of cardiotrophin 1 on atherosclerosis.", "venue": "Hypertension", "journalPages": "942-50", "authors": [{"ids": ["10105164"], "name": "Hanae Konii"}, {"ids": ["1746085"], "name": "Kengo Sato"}, {"ids": ["10562301"], "name": "Sayaka Kikuchi"}, {"ids": ["10133999"], "name": "Hazuki Okiyama"}, {"ids": ["10214559"], "name": "Rena Watanabe"}, {"ids": ["9794858"], "name": "Akinori Hasegawa"}, {"ids": ["5904655"], "name": "Keigo Yamamoto"}, {"ids": ["5540710"], "name": "Fumiko Itoh"}, {"ids": ["20658126"], "name": "Tsutomu Hirano"}, {"ids": ["1722154"], "name": "Takuya Watanabe"}], "inCitations": ["3cb1e4a12a666875ef3c958824abc03b3caaa4e0", "0613f989650db5254c693f3df468ca86d147d92f", "d7d7dd7a197d5d87b8badaa4e17b888c16d55bd6", "51ea008392135d21383c8288abe620520fcdd1e5", "a8245de529a6bf03422980f7553050b52c70fff1", "682f398208b608983613da1a3defc70d873be4f0"], "keyPhrases": [], "id": "001db33949711abfdbd8ae36fb5934750488e595"}, {"outCitations": [], "pdfUrls": [], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/001dcbafa91c8a53e4b7daeadd4c7513013a980f", "paperAbstract": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalName": "", "title": "An implementation of random single input change technique for low-power test", "venue": "", "journalPages": "", "authors": [], "inCitations": [], "keyPhrases": [], "id": "001dcbafa91c8a53e4b7daeadd4c7513013a980f"}, {"outCitations": [], "pdfUrls": [], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/001e81c760f28ae87ffe1e0d0a90e7d1d0da4a88", "paperAbstract": "AAEM MINIMONOGRAPH # 14 Temperature affects biologic and neurophysiologic processes and is, therefore, always well controlled in in vitro experiments.

To investigate differences in patterns of viral infection, we colabeled murine sensory ganglia for evidence of HSV infection and for the sensory neuron marker A5 or KH10. During acute infection, 7 to 10% of HSV-1 or HSV-2 antigen-positive neurons were A5 positive and 13 to 16% were KH10 positive, suggesting that both viruses reach each type of neuron in a manner proportional to their representation in uninfected ganglia. In murine trigeminal ganglia harvested during HSV latency, 25% of HSV-1 latency-associated transcript (LAT)- and 4% of HSV-2 LAT-expressing neurons were A5 positive, while 12% of HSV-1 LAT- and 42% of HSV-2 LAT-expressing neurons were KH10 positive. A similar difference was observed in murine dorsal root ganglia. These differences could not be attributed to differences in LAT expression levels in A5- versus KH10-positive neurons. Thus, HSV-1 demonstrated a preference for the establishment of latency in A5-positive neurons, while HSV-2 demonstrated a preference for the establishment of latency in KH10-positive neurons. A chimeric HSV-2 mutant that expresses the HSV-1 LAT exhibited an HSV-1 phenotype, preferentially establishing latency in A5-positive neurons.

HF rats were obtained by creating descending aortic constriction. 0.9% sodium chloride solution, recombinant adeno-associated virus carrying enhanced green fluorescent protein gene (rAAV2.eGFP) and recombinant adeno-associated virus carrying SERCA2a gene (rAAV2.SERCA2a), were respectively delivered to pericardium of HF rats in different groups by intrapericardial injection with a trans-diaphragmatic approach. 30 days after gene transfer, hemodynamic parameters, SERCA2a protein expression and SERCA2a activity were analyzed. The proteome difference from rat hearts between Groups HF + SERCA2a and HF was detected by expression proteomics. Electrophoretic separation and quantitation of cardiac myosin heavy chain isoforms of hearts in different groups were performed at 30 days.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt 30 days, left ventricular function improved significantly in HF rats infected with rAAV2.SERCA2a (LVSP 146.52 +/- 13.86 vs 97.91 +/- 12.13, LVEDP 7.88 +/- 2.88 vs 21.15 +/- 3.57, LV +dp/dt 11 206.16 +/- 1730.11 vs 5948.93 +/- 1283.43, LV -dp/dt -8249.54 +/- 1076.09 vs -4497.50 +/- 652.12; P < 0.05). The recovered cardiac function in Group HF + SERCA2a rats was comparable to control rats, and had lower LV-weight/Body-weight ratio (2.46 +/- 0.17 vs 2.71 +/- 0.24, P < 0.05). Overexpression of SERCA2a increased both the protein content (0.39 +/- 0.11 vs 1.11 +/- 0.18, P < 0.05) and activity (228.62 +/- 25.11 vs 82.55 +/- 14.13, P < 0.05) up to nonfailing levels. Expressions of some energy metabolic enzymes in hearts of Group HF + SERCA2a were much higher than those of HF group. They included creatine kinase-muscle, enolase beta, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, mitochondrial H(+)-ATP synthase alpha subunit, electron transfer flavoprotein alpha-subunit, H(+)-transporting ATP synthase and heart fatty acid binding protein. Downregulation of alpha-MHC and upregulation of beta-MHC in failing hearts were observed. Gene transfer of SERCA2a could increase the expression of alpha-MHC [(74.48 +/- 3.74)% vs (53.57 +/- 2.30)%, P < 0.05], and decrease the expression of beta-MHC [(25.52 +/- 3.74)% vs (46.43 +/- 2.30)%, P < 0.05] in HF rats. The expression profiles of alpha-MHC and beta-MHC and the ratio of alpha-MHC/beta-MHC were similar to those in controls.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAdeno-associated viral gene transfer of SERCA2a can enhance SERCA2a functions, maintain calcium homeostasis, improve cardiac energy metabolism, and normalize the expression of cardiac myosin heavy chain isoforms in HF rats. As a result, the ventricular systolic and diastolic functions can be improved significantly, and the hypertrophy of the heart may be reduced in clinic.

Emerging data support the existence of a cancer stem cell that shares features of tissue stem cells, including the ability to self-renew and undergo dysregulated differentiation. Here we show that a rare population of cells coexpressing MDR transporters and stem cell markers is a common feature across therapy-naive epithelial cancers as well as normal epithelial tissue. MDR+ and MDR- candidate tumor stem and progenitor populations were all capable of generating highly anaplastic transplantable human tumors in NOD/SCID. The finding that rare cells bearing stem cell markers and having intrinsic MDR expression and activity are already present within the tumorigenic compartment before treatment with cytotoxic agents is of critical importance to cancer therapy.

Under normal oxygen conditions, HIF-1alpha, the active subunit of HIF-1, is hydroxylated on proline residues by specific HIF prolyl-hydroxylases, leading to ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. In hypoxia, hydroxylation and ubiquitination are blocked and HIF-1alpha accumulates in cells. Recent studies have shown that in normal oxygen conditions G-protein-coupled receptor agonists, including angiotensin (Ang) II and thrombin, potently induce and activate HIF-1 in vascular smooth muscle cells. The current study identifies HIF-1alpha protein stabilization as a key mechanism for HIF-1 induction by Ang II. We show that hydroxylation on proline 402 is altered by Ang II, decreasing pVHL binding to HIF-1alpha and allowing HIF-1alpha protein to escape subsequent ubiquitination and degradation mechanisms. We show that HIF-1alpha stability is mediated through the Ang II-mediated generation of hydrogen peroxide and a subsequent decrease in ascorbate levels, leading to decreased HIF prolyl-hydroxylase activity and HIF-1alpha stabilization. These findings identify novel and intricate signaling mechanisms involved in HIF-1 complex activation and will lead to the elucidation of the importance of HIF-1 in different Ang II-related cell responses.", "journalVolume": "19 1", "journalName": "Molecular biology of the cell", "year": 2008, "title": "Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha stabilization in nonhypoxic conditions: role of oxidation and intracellular ascorbate depletion.", "venue": "Molecular biology of the cell", "journalPages": "86-94", "authors": [{"ids": ["8980487"], "name": "Elisabeth L.

This dimer structure is supported primarily by interactions between the first four amino-terminal and the last four carboxy-terminal amino acids. These eight amino acids form a beta-sheet in which hydrophobic residues are oriented towards the core of the molecule and polar residues are directed towards the solvent. Although the structure of the dimer interface has been determined, the forces that support dimerization have not been fully characterized. Here, we describe a tethered construct in which two protease monomers are joined by a 5 amino acid linker. We evaluate the relative role of each dimer interface residue in functional homo- and heterodimers. Our studies indicate that the hydrophobic residues of the dimer interface are particularly important in maintaining enzyme activity and that enzyme activity is more sensitive to substitutions of the C-terminal amino acids.

The difference bands were generated by cDNA representational difference analysis (cDNA RDA). The final difference products were ligated into the pUC-18 vector and sequenced. A bioformatics analysis was performed on the obtained expressed sequence tags (ESTs), and then the expression levels of known and novel genes were verified by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). At the same time, full-length cDNA of a novel gene was cloned in silico.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe type 2 diabetic rats in this experiment experienced hyperglycemia, lipidemia, lower insulin sensitivity and normal body weight. We obtained 9 novel ESTs and 2 novel genes from renal tissue of rats and 6 novel ESTs and 1 known gene, the rat lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene from their visceral adipose tissue. The 2 novel genes (RS91 and RS2) from the renal tissue were both very similar to serine (or cysteine) proteinase inhibitor, clade F and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 and subunit 5 (EIF-3 epsilon).

The objective of this study was to determine the comparative effectiveness of multislice helical CT alone to diagnose acute unstable cervical spine injury following blunt trauma.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe authors performed a meta-analysis of studies comparing modern CT with adjunctive imaging modalities and required that studies present acute traumatic findings as well as treatment for unstable injuries. Study quality, population characteristics, diagnostic protocols, and outcome data were extracted. Positive disease status included all injuries necessitating surgical or orthotic stabilization identified on imaging and/or clinical follow-up.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSeventeen studies encompassing 14,327 patients met the inclusion criteria. Overall, the sensitivity and specificity for modern CT were both > 99.9% (95% CI 0.99-1.00 and 0.99-1.00, respectively). The negative likelihood ratio of an unstable cervical injury after a CT scan negative for acute injury was < 0.001 (95% CI 0.00-0.01), while the negative predictive value of a normal CT scan was 100% (95% CI 0.96-1.00). Global severity of injury, CT slice thickness, and study quality did not significantly affect accuracy estimates.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nModern CT alone is sufficient to detect unstable cervical spine injuries in trauma patients. Adjuvant imaging is unnecessary when the CT scan is negative for acute injury.

In this study, the role of Kupffer cells in eliminating aged and apoptotic neutrophils was investigated. Liver, spleen, lung, and blood samples from Wistar rats were examined by light and electron microscopy, the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) method, and immunohistochemistry after the intravenous injection of OK-432, a streptococcal preparation. Neutrophils were trapped predominantly in the periportal and midzonal regions of hepatic lobules and were in contact with endothelial cells and Kupffer cells, or were surrounded by Kupffer cells. The trapping of neutrophils peaked after 6 hours. Apoptotic neutrophils, with or without buds, were found in the lumen of hepatic sinusoids as early as 6 hours, reached maximal levels after 12 hours, and represented greater than 60% of the total number of neutrophils in the liver. The presence of apoptotic neutrophils was correlated with the degree of neutrophil phagocytosis. Double-staining showed that TUNEL-positive neutrophils were phagocytosed or encircled by ED1- or ED2-positive Kupffer cells. In contrast, apoptosis and phagocytosis of neutrophils were rare in the spleen, lung, and peripheral blood. These results suggested that the appearance of apoptotic neutrophils in the hepatic sinusoids and their rapid clearance by Kupffer cells occurs after the invasion of bacteria (i.e., bacteremia or bacteriotoxemia) or the release of inflammatory mediators into the blood stream. These findings have important implications for the regulation of neutrophil homeostasis, the limitation of inflammation and tissue injury, and provide insight into the physiological removal of circulating, senescent neutrophils.", "journalVolume": "24 5", "journalName": "Hepatology", "year": 1996, "title": "Apoptosis of neutrophils and their elimination by Kupffer cells in rat liver.", "venue": "Hepatology", "journalPages": "1256-63", "authors": [{"ids": ["2234144"], "name": "Ji H.

This result was questioned by Helbig & Kayser, who pointed out that selection effects related to the brightness of the lens can bias the results of this test against a high \u03bb0 value; however, we did not claim that the observations favoured a high \u03bb0 value, merely that current observational data were not sufficient to say either way, using the test as proposed by Kochanek but corrected for selection effects. Kochanek pointed out that an additional observable, namely, the fraction of measured lens redshifts, provides additional information which restores the sensitivity of the test to the cosmological model, at least somewhat. Here, I consider three aspects. First, I discuss the appropriateness of the correction to the test proposed by Kochanek (1996a).

However, DNA-based analysis of organisms lacking sequenced genomes cannot rely on RNA-seq data alone to isolate most genes of interest, as DNA codes both exons and introns. With this in mind, we designed a novel tool, LEMONS, that exploits the evolutionary conservation of both exon/intron boundary positions and splice junction recognition signals to produce high throughput splice-junction predictions in the absence of a reference genome. When tested on multiple annotated vertebrate mRNA data, LEMONS accurately identified 87% (average) of the splice-junctions. LEMONS was then applied to our updated Mediterranean chameleon transcriptome, which lacks a reference genome, and predicted a total of 90,820 exon-exon junctions. We experimentally verified these splice-junction predictions by amplifying and sequencing twenty randomly selected genes from chameleon DNA templates. Exons and introns were detected in 19 of 20 of the positions predicted by LEMONS.

Funding from the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts (NESTA), Learning Programme, has enabled a collaborative approach to the development of the ReActivities\u00a9 software. As a result of working directly with children on the autistic spectrum and those who support them, an organic design process has emerged which embraces their distinct needs and characteristics. Discovering how autistic children play has been revelatory. Something which normally developing children experience so naturally is often profoundly missing in autistic children for whom high levels of anxiety can inhibit playful experiences and increase the rigid, stereotypical and challenging behaviours which have a negative effect in social situations. Interactions with objects that offer repetition, pattern and similarity combined with colour and rhythm are regularly used by autistic children as methods to reduce anxiety, however little has been done to interpret these sensations in digital environments. Thus the aim of ReActivities\u00a9 has been to offer a rich physical and cognitive experience which simulates the perceptible characteristics of phenomena such as elasticity, velocity, gravity and inertia. This is an advanced form of cause and effect that promises a unique form of expression in response to exploration with computer technology. There are numerous thoughtful and engaging websites designed and maintained by autistic people which are testimony to the theory that computers, and particularly electronic networks, offer enormous possibilities for creativity, communication and fun, which are so often suppressed by the tensions and anxieties of daily life. In response to this the project is utilising open source technology to enable autistic users, many of whom are already conversant with programming languages, to adapt and re-generate the software. Fostering a community approach to development affords further opportunities to explore an innovative, inclusive design method that, should it prove successful, could provide a model for other marginalised groups.", "journalVolume": "17", "journalName": "Digital Creativity", "year": 2006, "title": "ReActivities \u00a9: autism and play", "venue": "Digital Creativity", "journalPages": "149-156", "authors": [{"ids": ["2697544"], "name": "Wendy Keay-Bright"}], "inCitations": ["0876501785848b8ede72c33f44de0a01776c228e", "2f89600274bf8c5ff05af9e6654359c4cb619808"], "keyPhrases": [], "id": "002b6e3ec450c204907ec65b414aac587c4690ae"}, {"outCitations": [], "pdfUrls": ["https://media.blackhat.com/eu-13/briefings/Jodeit/bh-eu-13-hacking-video-jodeit-wp.pdf"], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/002b8aed02860056b2817a0a47d54c6388410785", "paperAbstract": "High-end videoconferencing systems are widely deployed at critical locations such as corporate meeting rooms or boardrooms.

After analyzing the software update file format and showing how to get system level access to the otherwise closed devices we describe how to setup a proper vulnerability development environment which lays the groundwork for future security research. We demonstrate the feasibility of remotely compromising Polycom HDX devices over the network by implementing an exploit for one of the vulnerabilities we identified in the H.323 stack of the current software version which allows us to compromise even firewalled devices as long as the H.323 port is reachable.

To study whether schizotypy is associated with differences in how categories activate their exemplars, we examined the N400 component of the event-related brain potential (ERP) elicited during a category-verification task. ERPs were recorded in young adults from the general population while they viewed category definitions each followed by a target that was either a high-typicality exemplar, low-typicality exemplar, or non-exemplar; participants' task was to indicate whether or not the target belonged to the category. Schizotypy was assessed via the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ). Overall, N400 amplitude was largest for non-exemplars, smallest for high-typicality exemplars, and intermediate for low-typicality exemplars. SPQ score was associated with decreased N400 amplitude to non-exemplars, and increased amplitude to both types of exemplars.

However, subgroup analysis found that -460TT homozygote variant might confer significantly increased cancer risk for Asians (TT vs. CC: OR=1.69, 95% CI 1.08-2.63, p=0.02), but not in Caucasians. Similar results were observed in -2578C>A in Asians (AA vs. CC: OR=3.00, 95% CI 1.51-5.95, p=0.002; AA vs. AC: OR=3.15, 95% CI 1.00-9.91, p=0.05; AA vs. (AC+CC): OR=2.92, 95% CI 1.51-5.65, p=0.001). In lung cancer survival, 4 trials included had conflicting results. One found -460C>T polymorphism had no effect on survival, 1 observed risk increasing, while the remaining 2 observed risk decreasing. This inconsistency was closely related to the different therapeutic practices applied in different studies, the effects of which were significantly affected by VEGF expression.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n-460TT and -2578AA homozygote might lead to significantly increased cancer risk for Asians, but the effects on survival remain to be explored. These 2 SNPs might be potential indicators of lung cancer risk for Asians and should be considered when planning chemotherapy and radiotherapy for lung cancer patients.", "journalVolume": "20", "journalName": "", "year": 2014, "title": "rs833061 and rs699947 on Promoter Gene of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and Associated Lung Cancer Susceptibility and Survival: A Meta-Analysis", "venue": "Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research", "journalPages": "2520 - 2526", "authors": [{"ids": ["4327472"], "name": "Junwei Tu"}, {"ids": ["4020642"], "name": "Saibin Wang"}, {"ids": ["3929619"], "name": "Jianping Zhao"}, {"ids": ["15522188"], "name": "Jingqian Zhu"}, {"ids": ["10745333"], "name": "Lin Sheng"}, {"ids": ["7844396"], "name": "Yijun Sheng"}, {"ids": ["7314469"], "name": "Huijun Chen"}, {"ids": ["26765897"], "name": "Jianghua Tian"}], "inCitations": ["1dd6cecff1ff737b38fecd896e0fda05c53b4203", "1c9c0ecf5397527796d2e15e3a018a68b27b6298", "f6aab4f48c2cd3aa65ab226c4401dd7073a7a4cf", "caf0df12d6532a4f878d056bbaa84bef9d5fa4d4"], "keyPhrases": ["Cancer Risk", "Asian", "Caucasian", "Lung Cancer Patient", "T Polymorphism"], "id": "0030c7052fdba87fa2629976aad5c7380f97c82d"}, {"outCitations": [], "pdfUrls": [], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00317af374b90bcf3301f60c59ca2a7a5141e3f9", "paperAbstract": "This report is an extension and complement of a previous study reporting the effect of three herbicides (paraquat, dinoseb and 2,4-D) on cell viability, GSH oxidation, NADH and ATP depletion (Arch. Toxicol. 68:24-31, 1994). Here we report additional data and findings aimed at a better understanding of the toxicity mechanisms induced by these herbicides. Biochemical mechanisms of cytotoxicity induced by the herbicides paraquat (1,1'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridylium dichloride), dinoseb (2-sec-butyl-4,6-dinitrophenol) and 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) were investigated in freshly isolated rat hepatocytes. Herbicide metabolism, especially paraquat and 2,4-D, rapidly depletes GSH and protein thiols. Paraquat and 2,4-D (1-10 mM) decrease the GSH/GSSG ratio, promote loss of protein thiol contents and induce lipid peroxidation. Dinoseb, the most effective cytotoxic compound under study (used in concentrations 1000-fold lower than paraquat and 2,4-D), had moderate effects upon the GSH/GSSG ratio and lipid peroxidation, causing a depletion of protein thiols of about 20%. The results indicate that the herbicides paraquat and 2,4-D are hepatotoxic and may induce cell death by decreasing cellular GSH/GSSG ratio and protein thiols, and by inducing lipid peroxidation. The cytotoxic action of dinoseb is likely to be related with the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. Therefore, it is likely that liver damage observed during the first phase of herbicide-intoxication is related to these metabolic processes.", "journalVolume": "81 2-3", "journalName": "Toxicology letters", "year": 1995, "title": "Thiols metabolism is altered by the herbicides paraquat, dinoseb and 2,4-D: a study in isolated hepatocytes.", "venue": "Toxicology letters", "journalPages": "115-23", "authors": [{"ids": ["5897616"], "name": "Carlos Manuel Marques Palmeira"}, {"ids": ["4971752"], "name": "Antonio Joaquim Moreno"}, {"ids": ["8264557"], "name": "V\u00edtor M.

The evolution to hormone-resistance status leads to a fatal tumor progression. High-dose fosfestrol (diethylstilbestrol diphosphate) has been suggested to circumvent hormone-resistance and to induce a direct cytotoxic effect. Sixteen patients with hormone-resistant prostate cancer were treated by continuous infusion of high-dose fosfestrol according to two schedules: 10 patients were included in a phase I trial of a daily escalating dose from 1.5 g/d to 4.5 g/d for 7 to 10 days. Six other patients were uniformly treated by 4 g/d for 3.5 h for 5 days. Between each course, patients received orally 300 mg/d fosfestrol and 200 mg/d salicylic acid. The mean age was 65 years (range 51-75). Mean number of courses was two (extremes 1-7). Toxicities: reversible weight gain was observed in five patients. One patient presented a pulmonary edema which was resolved immediately after diuretics. One patient and 9 patients respectively experienced grade III and II (OMS) nausea and vomiting. Transient perineal pruritus occurred in 5 patients. Responses: 15 patients were evaluable (one early death occurred on day 3 from tumor progression complicated by an intravascular coagulation disease). There were four objective stabilizations (NPCP criteria) lasting 2 m, 2 m, 5 m and 10 m respectively. Subjective improvement of pain was observed in five other patients.

Although studies of the economic impacts of improved N management have begun to take into account farmers and the environment, this is the first study to consider the fertilizer industry. Our \"sweet spot\" hypothesis is evaluated via a cost-benefit analysis of moderate and ambitious N use efficiency targets in U.S. and China corn sectors over the period 2015-2035. We use a blend of publicly available crop and energy price projections, original time-series modeling, and expert elicitation. The results present a mixed picture: although the potential for a \"sweet spot\" exists in both countries, it is more likely that one occurs in China due to the currently extensive overapplication of fertilizer, which creates a greater potential for farmers and the fertilizer industry to gain economically from improved N management. Nevertheless, the environmental benefits of improving N management consistently dwarf the economic impacts on farmers and the fertilizer industry in both countries, suggesting that viable policy options could include incentives to farmers and the fertilizer industry to increase their support for N management policies.", "journalVolume": "44 2", "journalName": "Journal of environmental quality", "year": 2015, "title": "Reducing Nitrogen Pollution while Decreasing Farmers' Costs and Increasing Fertilizer Industry Profits.", "venue": "Journal of environmental quality", "journalPages": "325-35", "authors": [{"ids": ["20482638"], "name": "David R.

Page used to say that the regular occurrence of constant amounts of a substance in the body is seldom without purpose and that organisms exhibit an inner economy and prudence by using one substance for several functions. Almost 50 years later, we are now challenged again to decipher just how complicated and how physiologically relevant are newly discovered biochemical pathways contributing to the formation of biologically active forms of angiotensin peptides. The need to revisit the role of angiotensin-forming enzymes was stimulated by the finding of a new gene encoding a protein having highest homology to the testes-specific isoform of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).1,2 In 1991, we first suggested3 that angiotensin II (Ang II) should be viewed as one but not the sole principal product of the renin-angiotensin system. The proposal was based on the characterization of biological actions of the heptapeptide angiotensin-(1\u20137) [Ang-(1\u20137)] and its forming enzymes. There was reluctance to accept this concept in part because the potential role of Ang-(1\u20137) in cardiovascular regulation was still at an embryonic stage, there was little evidence that Ang II could act at more than one receptor, and a full characterization of other enzymic pathways for angiotensin peptide formation had not been achieved yet. The situation is quite different today; a growing body of literature now implicates Ang-(1\u20137)3\u20137 and angiotensin IV (Ang-3\u20138)8 as components of the system, and additional work has identified chymase, prolyl endopeptidase 24.26, neutral endopeptidase 24.11, metalloendopeptidase 24.15,9 and now a homologue of ACE10 as angiotensin prohormone convertases. Fifty years after the discovery of ACE, a homologue of human ACE has been reported from genomics-based strategies. The protein identified by Tipnis et al1 and named ACEH was cloned from a human lymphoma cDNA library, and an identical human protein termed ACE2 was cloned from a cDNA library prepared from ventricular tissue from a patient with heart failure by Donoghue and associates.2 To prevent confusion and prudently wait for the International Enzyme Nomenclature Committee to define the proper nomenclature, we will refer to this discovery as ACEH/ACE2, recognizing that it is the name but not the nature of the enzyme that remains at question. ACEH/ACE2 is a zinc metalloprotease consisting of 805 amino acids with considerable homology to ACE, but unlike somatic ACE, it functions as a carboxypeptidase rather than a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase.1,2 The full-length cDNA encoding ACEH/ACE2 includes an N-terminal signal sequence and a hydrophobic region near the C-terminus with an overall 40% identity to the Nand C-domains of ACE. Contrasting with ACE, ACEH/ACE2 hydrolyses Ang I into Ang-(1\u20139), Ang II into Ang-(1\u20137), and bradykinin to [des-Arg9]bradykinin (Figure). In other words, ACEH/ACE2 does not convert Ang I into Ang II; it does not cleave bradykinin itself, and, importantly, its enzymatic activity is inhibited by neither captopril or lisinopril. ACEH/ACE2 is a type I membrane protein that is primarily localized to the heart (myocytes), kidney (endothelium and tubular elements), and testes.2,10 A glimpse into the potential importance of ACEH/ACE2 in the regulation of cardiovascular function was demonstrated by Crackower et al,11 who localized the ACEH/ACE2 gene to the human X chromosome. This is an exciting finding, since the same locus on the X chromosome has been reported to show a significant logarithm-of-the-odds score in rat models of hypertension.12 Crackower and associates11 also found severe cardiac contractile dysfunction associated with mild ventricular dilation in ACEH/ACE2 knockout mice [(ACEH/ ACE2]. These changes in cardiac function were associated with upregulation of hypoxia-induced genes.

We examined the effects of KCl, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), veratridine, ouabain and tetraphenylphosphonium cation (TPP+) on Ca(2+)-independent (carrier-mediated) and Ca(2+)-dependent (exocytotic) release. We found that, in the absence of Ca2+, KCl at 40 mM releases 7.57 +/- 0.65%, veratridine at 50 microM releases 45.85 +/- 2.48%, ouabain at 1 mM releases 8.62 +/- 0.93% and TPP+ at 1 mM releases 4.09 +/- 0.37% of the total accumulated neurotransmitter, provided that the external medium contains Na+. These are about the maximal values of release obtained with each depolarizing agent in a Na+ medium and in the absence of Ca2+. Replacing external Na+ with choline blocks the release observed in the presence of the depolarizing agents in the absence of Ca2+, and this divalent ion can increase [3H]GABA release only for K+ or 4-AP. Synaptosomal depolarization requires Na+ except for K+ depolarization. Furthermore, although Ca2+ stimulates the release of [3H]GABA due to K+ depolarization (13.56 +/- 0.44%) or due to 4-AP (4.26 +/- 0.51%), it inhibits the release due to the other depolarizing agents. The amount of [3H]GABA released by 4-AP in Na+ medium (4.26 +/- 0.51%) is similar to that induced by KCl in the presence of Ca2+ in the absence of Na+ (3.39 +/- 0.29%) which represents only exocytotic release. This suggests that the Ca(2+)-dependent exocytotic release of [3H]GABA can be specifically induced by 4-AP in a Na+ medium, or by KCl in the absence of Na+, as reported by us earlier. The observation that Ca2+ inhibits the Ca(2+)-independent release is of interest because it suggests that Ca2+ may modulate the release of cytoplasmic GABA probably by inhibiting the carrier-mediated release of GABA. It is of interest as to whether Ca2+ regulation depends on intracellular Ca2+.", "journalVolume": "44 2", "journalName": "Biochemical pharmacology", "year": 1992, "title": "Effect of depolarizing agents on the Ca(2+)-independent and Ca(2+)-dependent release of [3H]GABA from sheep brain synaptosomes.", "venue": "Biochemical pharmacology", "journalPages": "301-8", "authors": [{"ids": ["23025033"], "name": "Marta S.

In addition, maximum chest acceleration must still not be exceeded, according to legal requirements. With regard to the neck criterion Nij, tests with the HIII 5% dummy have shown that Nij-values, relevant for the rating, can already arise during pretensioning or during the subsequent coupling phase, prior to the load limiting phase. From this it follows that the maximum pretensioning performance may be limited by this criterion for a few vehicle environments on the passenger side.

In this paper, a theory based on multi-variable information fusion is studied to evaluate the health level of multifunctional sensors. A novel conception of health reliability degree (HRD) is defined to indicate a quantitative health level, which is different from traditional so-called qualitative fault diagnosis. To evaluate the health condition from both local and global perspectives, the HRD of a single sensitive component at multiple time points and the overall multifunctional sensor at a single time point are defined, respectively. The HRD methodology is emphasized by using multi-variable data fusion technology coupled with a grey comprehensive evaluation method. In this method, to acquire the distinct importance of each sensitive unit and the sensitivity of different time points, the information entropy and analytic hierarchy process method are used, respectively. In order to verify the feasibility of the proposed strategy, a health evaluating experimental system for multifunctional self-validating sensors was designed. The five different health level situations have been discussed. Successful results show that the proposed method is feasible, the HRD could be used to quantitatively indicate the health level and it does have a fast response to the performance changes of multifunctional sensors.", "journalVolume": "13", "journalName": "", "year": 2013, "title": "A Novel Health Evaluation Strategy for Multifunctional Self-Validating Sensors", "venue": "Sensors", "journalPages": "587 - 610", "authors": [{"ids": ["2434776"], "name": "Zhengguang Shen"}, {"ids": ["1695099"], "name": "Qi Wang"}], "inCitations": [], "keyPhrases": ["HRD", "Health Level", "Health Evaluation", "Sensitive Unit", "Experimental"], "id": "003d2e721c381a450ef106cd3ecf6c63c251578e"}, {"outCitations": [], "pdfUrls": [], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/003d918ff7e8f477d9ff9aaa9921ecf2a63cbeec", "paperAbstract": "Many individuals who inject drugs do not access existing needle and syringe exchange programs.

We assessed whether home-based HIV care was as effective as was facility-based care.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe undertook a cluster-randomised equivalence trial in Jinja, Uganda. 44 geographical areas in nine strata, defined according to ratio of urban and rural participants and distance from the clinic, were randomised to home-based or facility-based care by drawing sealed cards from a box. The trial was integrated into normal service delivery. All patients with WHO stage IV or late stage III disease or CD4-cell counts fewer than 200 cells per microL who started antiretroviral therapy between Feb 15, 2005, and Dec 19, 2006, were eligible, apart from those living on islands. Follow-up continued until Jan 31, 2009. The primary endpoint was virological failure, defined as RNA more than 500 copies per mL after 6 months of treatment. The margin of equivalence was 9% (equivalence limits 0.69-1.45). Analyses were by intention to treat and adjusted for baseline CD4-cell count and study stratum. This trial is registered at http://isrctn.org, number ISRCTN 17184129.\n\n\nFINDINGS\n859 patients (22 clusters) were randomly assigned to home and 594 (22 clusters) to facility care. During the first year, 93 (11%) receiving home care and 66 (11%) receiving facility care died, 29 (3%) receiving home and 36 (6%) receiving facility care withdrew, and 8 (1%) receiving home and 9 (2%) receiving facility care were lost to follow-up. 117 of 729 (16%) in home care had virological failure versus 80 of 483 (17%) in facility care: rates per 100 person-years were 8.19 (95% CI 6.84-9.82) for home and 8.67 (6.96-10.79) for facility care (rate ratio [RR] 1.04, 0.78-1.40; equivalence shown). Two patients from each group were immediately lost to follow-up.

One of the genes has been designated nirV. Putative nirV orthologues are found in other denitrifiers, where they are also located downstream of the structural gene for nitrite reductase. The nirV in 2.4.3 is apparently cotranscribed with nirK. Inactivation of nirV had no effect on cell growth, or on nitrite reductase expression or activity. Downstream of nirV and divergently transcribed is a gene, designated ppaZ, encoding a protein with significant similarity to pseudoazurins from other denitrifiers. However, three of the four residues required for binding of the type I copper centre are not conserved in the deduced sequence of the protein in 2.4.3. ppaZ is expressed only when oxygen becomes limiting. ppaZ expression is dependent on both FnrL and NnrR, and a putative binding site for these proteins has been identified. Expression of ppaZ is also dependent on the two-component PrrB/PrrA system. Inactivation of ppaZ had no significant effect on cell growth or on nitrite reductase expression or activity. Expression of a maltose-binding protein-PpaZ fusion indicated that the protein could not bind copper. Examination of the genome of the related bacterium R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 revealed that it encodes ppaZ but not nirV and evidence is presented suggesting that a common ancestor of 2.4.3 and 2.4.1 had both nitrite and nitric oxide reductase activity but as the strains diverged 2.4.1 lost nirK and nirV, making it incapable of nitrite reduction.", "journalVolume": "147 Pt 9", "journalName": "Microbiology", "year": 2001, "title": "Characterization of nirV and a gene encoding a novel pseudoazurin in Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.3.", "venue": "Microbiology", "journalPages": "2505-15", "authors": [{"ids": ["1693492"], "name": "Ruchi Jain"}, {"ids": ["6840708"], "name": "James P.

The challenges faced by international medical graduates have been acknowledged through the proliferation of orientation programmes designed within hospitals. This paper discusses and evaluates a pilot orientation programme for doctors in Victoria, Australia, called Transition in Practice.\n\n\nMETHODS\nDrawing on theories of active reflection and situated learning, the programme entailed fortnightly meetings for new international medical graduates at a metropolitan hospital in Victoria. The programme comprised a series of informal discussion sessions where doctors were facilitated to actively reflect on everyday practical challenges in their hospital work. Local medical and non-medical staff were invited to each session. Data comprised doctors' reflections about new insights gathered at the conclusion of each session.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThematic analysis of 55 evaluation cards revealed that participants benefited from the programme by learning directly from invited staff members' descriptions of their roles and their specific areas of practice. Participants gained increased awareness of the differences between their past and present work environments, and greater insight into the complexities of the local system. Participating doctors became actively involved in their own orientation process, generating new topics for future discussions.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis programme successfully integrated experiences and views of both international medical graduates and local hospital staff to generate a greater understanding of each other and of the workplace. The programme used simple, inexpensive methods that tapped into the resources that both international medical graduates and local staff bring to the workplace.", "journalVolume": "10 5", "journalName": "The clinical teacher", "year": 2013, "title": "International medical graduates in transition.", "venue": "The clinical teacher", "journalPages": "328-32", "authors": [{"ids": ["7213492"], "name": "Anna Harris"}, {"ids": ["6427988"], "name": "Clare Delany"}], "inCitations": ["eb29c48419ee894a9b959c52a8c6ce2b60ab8f0a"], "keyPhrases": [], "id": "003f64141261324ee66d4e2e9a9b11104705f32e"}, {"outCitations": ["4d93d51b6b2bca2d7ed2b167b77037b81b940fab", "36d8e2daf069fdb43805a3cadd7f9186917a1951", "6a8417f9618d323658be9e682c64189c0e579194", "e3230d601cd1341f7490d2ebd5823bc78a795bfd", "56250f72e0e21554eb29b8c3c0bb314444754619", "38ffd1971b2f9e36552209f7d9a311454299e598", "c9dc4507aed205fc7dfb98013637f6e06f0070f6", "8d65b73f89399696a87e42bbcce88dd296c2910d", "92bce577af23a92965a99395c5b50467eccabe9f", "86c4e62cd589fcc5a3139241b0b8932220d56ef6", "db704bb47a3f6742d92d7810cb7ff20ff1ec0b5e", "bbea30564fb95d478caf6776a4e0ac3720a5728d", "46b248016e5adea72465118ce6d6864b051aaaf2", "fef2cdf9b74644d316fd6290eed29b485436348d", "dc6364c84dad259af27c38f7402c768159e65f39", "8fc38c526eb2aea1a9cd5de95d8eb9af092f5440", "39763a5ac48df4fab999bf8da445d62cc5a3a1fb", "1162dd607a17212e1be7e116f6d93df1394aaafc", "085c0e72a4628f19123ce0c0dda2072687c2c971", "0c8b41428da1b55500c528df6d947bec0c8716ae", "ff1ae95e141200189e4ce43c8b58b97f9fa4d5b9", "d89d9c0144c84e1446ac39087ff436eb582a30e6", "99f904c05c70d3cbaebc5b2e35f8052912f1c569", "9ec5f7ce4afd4305b21c81de616966374f2104ac"], "pdfUrls": ["http://rmdopen.bmj.com/content/rmdopen/1/1/e000118.full.pdf", "http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/85/a4/rmdopen-2015-000118.PMC4623362.pdf"], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/003f95335b69fb8b325921205eb7185085d952bf", "paperAbstract": "OBJECTIVE\nA systematic review and meta-analysis of data from cohort studies to analyse the diagnostic performances (ie, sensitivity and specificity) of ultrasound (US) for diagnosis of calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease with microscopic crystal detection used as a gold standard.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe performed a systematic review of articles published up to December 2014 using EMBASE, MEDLINE and Cochrane databases and abstracts from the past two EULAR and ACR annual meetings. Only studies reporting the performance of US for diagnosis of CPPD disease were selected. A meta-analysis involved the inverse variance method to evaluate global sensitivity and specificity of US. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed by the Cochran Q-test and I(2) values.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe search resulted in 85 articles and 11 abstracts; 17 and 4, respectively, were selected for the systematic review. A total of 262 patients with CPPD disease and 335 controls from 4 original articles and 4 abstracts were included in the meta-analysis. The US diagnostic patterns most frequently recorded were thin hyperechoic bands in the hyaline cartilage (8 articles); hyperechoic spots in fibrous cartilage or in tendons (7 articles); and homogeneous hyperechoic nodules localised in bursa or articular recesses (4 articles). The meta-analysis revealed a heterogeneity of the data, with a sensitivity of 87.9% (95% CI 80.9% to 94.9%) and specificity of 91.5% (95% CI 85.5% to 97.5%) using a random model.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis meta-analysis confirmed that US has high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CPPD and may be a promising tool for the diagnosis and management of CPPD.", "journalVolume": "1", "journalName": "", "year": 2015, "title": "Diagnostic value of ultrasound in calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis", "venue": "RMD open", "journalPages": "563 - 70", "authors": [{"ids": ["6858664"], "name": "Etienne Gamon"}, {"ids": ["4367398"], "name": "Bernard G Combe"}, {"ids": ["6426588"], "name": "Thomas Barnetche"}, {"ids": ["6647457"], "name": "Ga\u00ebl Mouterde"}], "inCitations": ["60746d20d2a63389ef888479d6bf9e594b8b3bd2", "2b5c7054f4ea48035270cccf685b414839a12aa4"], "keyPhrases": ["CPPD", "Sensitivity And Specificity", "Ultrasound", "Systematic Review And Meta-analysis"], "id": "003f95335b69fb8b325921205eb7185085d952bf"}, {"outCitations": [], "pdfUrls": [], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/003f9ad1d8814542993dce9c56f30980ac5282a9", "paperAbstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo examine the relationship between longitudinal fluctuations in synovitis with change in pain and cartilage in knee osteoarthritis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nStudy subjects were patients 45 years of age and older with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis from the Boston Osteoarthritis of the Knee Study. Baseline and follow-up assessments at 15 and 30 months included knee magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), BMI and pain assessment (VAS) over the last week. Synovitis was scored at 3 locations (infrapatellar fat pad, suprapatellar and intercondylar regions) using a semiquantitative scale (0-3) at all 3 time points on MRI. Scores at each site were added to give a summary synovitis score (0-9).\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe assessed 270 subjects whose mean (SD) age was 66.7 (9.2) years, BMI 31.5 (5.7) kg/m(2); 42% were female. There was no correlation of baseline synovitis with baseline pain score (r = 0.09, p = 0.17). The change in summary synovitis score was correlated with the change in pain (r = 0.21, p = 0.0003). An increase of one unit in summary synovitis score resulted in a 3.15-mm increase in VAS pain score (0-100 scale). Effusion change was not associated with pain change. Of the 3 locations for synovitis, changes in the infrapatellar fat pad were most strongly related to pain change. Despite cartilage loss occurring in over 50% of knees, synovitis was not associated with cartilage loss in either tibiofemoral or patellofemoral compartment.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nChange in synovitis was correlated with change in knee pain, but not loss of cartilage.

The second problem concerns the integration of several representations of the same knowledge with diierent degrees of formalization, ranging from formally represented knowledge via semi-structured text to plain text. It is argued to solve the two integration problems by making use of a high-level language whose representation ontology is explicitly deened.

Recent studies have demonstrated increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) in NAFLD. However, information on the mechanism of increased risk of AF in NAFLD is lacking. Impaired atrial conduction is an important factor in the pathophysiology of AF. We aimed to investigate atrial conduction properties in patients with NAFLD by tissue Doppler echocardiography. Fifty-nine ultrasound diagnosed NAFLD patients without clinical diagnosis of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or cardiac disease and 22 normal subjects as controls were included in this study. Atrial conduction properties were assessed by electromechanical delay (EMD) derived from Doppler tissue echocardiography examination and P-wave dispersion (PWD) calculated from the 12-lead electrocardiogram. Inter-atrial and intra-atrial EMD intervals were significantly longer in NAFLD patients than in controls (inter-atrial EMD, 31.9 \u00b1\u20038.5 ms vs. 23.4 \u00b1\u20034.6 ms,p= 0.0001, and intra-atrial EMD, 14.3 \u00b1\u20035.2 vs. 10.2 \u00b1\u20034.0 ms,p= 0.001). Similarly, PWD was significantly higher in NAFLD patients compared with controls (49.2 \u00b1\u20036.3 ms vs. 43.3 \u00b1\u20034.2 ms,p= 0.0001). Maximum left atrial volume was also significantly higher in the NAFLD group than in controls (51 \u00b1\u200311 mL vs. 34 \u00b1\u20039 mL,p< 0.0001). This study demonstrated that atrial conduction is impaired in patients with NAFLD. Also, in a patient population of NAFLD without any clinical diagnosis of cardiac disease, diabetes, or hypertension, left atrial volume was increased compared with controls. These findings suggest impaired atrial conduction as a factor in increased risk of AF in NAFLD.", "journalVolume": "38 3", "journalName": "Ultrasonic imaging", "year": 2016, "title": "Doppler Tissue Evaluation of Atrial Conduction Properties in Patients With Non-alcoholic Fatty-liver Disease.", "venue": "Ultrasonic imaging", "journalPages": "225-35", "authors": [{"ids": ["6702290"], "name": "Olcay Ozveren"}, {"ids": ["6703819"], "name": "Cemil Izgi"}, {"ids": ["1821636"], "name": "Elif Ero\u011flu"}, {"ids": ["4244716"], "name": "Mustafa Aytek Simsek"}, {"ids": ["11013135"], "name": "Ayca Turer"}, {"ids": ["4434833"], "name": "Zekeriya Kucukdurmaz"}, {"ids": ["6628118"], "name": "Veysel Cinar"}, {"ids": ["3142313"], "name": "Muzaffer Degertekin"}], "inCitations": ["829c58ffc5f5a59c1f824a0b66440bea736c4d0f", "9962684bc58191571cbed448cfb95c5bd831fbf5", "2b0a79aa1514edf4d3690c3491c1f73d2aa06de3", "6e3243feb368e16b7cf3b5938bda74539b3508cb"], "keyPhrases": [], "id": "0040de146d98adca1038a07cdeea461ba34a6c1f"}, {"outCitations": [], "pdfUrls": [], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0041646975bf06b679e48ee732584a3e280411db", "paperAbstract": "Atrial fibrillation is the most common atrial tachyarrhythmia. Consideration for the potential conversion of atrial fibrillation and the subsequent maintenance of sinus rhythm may be related to underlying pathology. Typically, extra cardiac factors such as thyroid hyperactivity help to determine initial therapy. Intrinsic cardiac factors may also influence the clinician's decision regarding potential cardioversion and maintenance of sinus rhythm. Some acute events such as pericarditis and the effects of cardiac trauma may resolve and result in spontaneous restoration of sinus rhythm. Other cardiac events such as acute myocardial infarction with or without atrial ischemia, valvular disease, and others may result in the precipitation of atrial fibrillation. The major reasons to consider cardioversion, either medically or electrically, are ventricular rate control, hemodynamic improvement, sense of well being, and the avoidance of embolism. Certain clinical situations (e.g., Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome) require urgent restoration of sinus rhythm in light of the potential for extremely rapid ventricular rates. It has been suggested that all antiarrhythmic drug administration should be initiated in the hospital setting, but the brief period of drug administration in an inpatient setting does not protect the patient from potential, late-onset proarrhythmic events. Both antiarrhythmic drug therapy and electric cardioversion are useful for restoration of sinus rhythm in both acute and chronic atrial fibrillation. The most important negative aspect of drug conversion of atrial fibrillation may be the potential development of a proarrhythmic drug effect. Although controversial, conversion (medical or electrical) is probably indicated in every patient with the first episode of persistent atrial fibrillation, even if the patient is asymptomatic.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "journalVolume": "17 9 Suppl 2", "journalName": "Clinical cardiology", "year": 1994, "title": "Should every patient with atrial fibrillation have the rhythm converted to sinus rhythm?", "venue": "Clinical cardiology", "journalPages": "II16-20", "authors": [{"ids": ["6878924"], "name": "William Mandel"}], "inCitations": ["086ad3c98e911bb98bee503d64cbea37099ad749"], "keyPhrases": [], "id": "0041646975bf06b679e48ee732584a3e280411db"}, {"outCitations": ["6f6574031173260cb7174359f77d988dd6dd8720", "95e83c3f08dbd73fa9fb661b12b0d3f6e7508533", "7f5fd2050111023209f57d781e596d2a03dcb8db", "f2e24588ffe67416f559c18a99326af002750490", "a4ed94003948b3238c68e681341ea5bef234a664", "98acffcbc43eb04c265fbb9d91fee1ea7eaec16e", "b4e264fb450a0499d2b03df75ca517e2aca33e60", "40f7b21b31bc4220404996fbcf35ab1adbc9716f", "9c8e3093f43fcf2a4c877c0c4a51646472572dfb", "8a6dffe67d6fdb68f182616fcda2d11ba72205d5", "3643357c7448a7014260e9d354f8d171c7a8cdcb", "06414cb843aa1b1a265ffc6bdca2e9ff154bd621", "d426f5c7ed86065ccd33c94a570435ddbe4857d1", "34e2e1d5f881e1c689354d53682f3e21719af821", "d214a176f6e19e50e413aee75c0788e99672301b", "07cc384a4c2509a4abfb7ee1a316aebf5b705156", "20f18031be623a5989fcde5cac745813cb067502", "4aacfd19221e4962d217ee377f46d024d4f5a356", "89b16a15d3df86de2954852e5b5f3616bab6a5f7", "38b67401357b2c198f8fe521204eb78e6728e2f3", "043c927e9eaee1abf5e3f11d30abaa37205b8d02", "7f698449ee4e15ed92ee48edc3854472990e7069", "bea54495b407ac786abf99170e6cf275b1e1dfae", "09c4e7af0eb78a2949eb66e634d10b15807788de", "86022c4a7fea037c8a8188af66e086d35e9fb2c9", "757187e1856e75194c303e691903304fd8ed197d", "1da9f85aa3464ce45590e51fc3b5eda7597ed3f4", "5370b7de01653a107385444e9ef176e745ffc4fc", "139898faf9ced160f15ab3938a2e145d3bc54683", "191505925585d385205c3c6129914d6223631888", "110f30587d7fabcb687b90d9f0c44df781b6a52c", "a53625167870ca2e57bf106fe91eedca609d5a5f", "ceef75e5c2b118884fa2662a9e018a47a0004f8e"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6651/7/10/4099/pdf"], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0043b2ddfb4cafc74de7f1cc8986d9adae443011", "paperAbstract": "Most pathogenic, non-O1/non-O139 serogroup Vibrio cholerae strains cause diarrheal disease in the absence of cholera toxin. Instead, many use Type 3 Secretion System (T3SS) mediated mechanisms to disrupt host cell homeostasis. We identified a T3SS effector protein, VopX, which is translocated into mammalian cells during in vitro co-culture. In a S. cerevisiae model system, we found that expression of VopX resulted in a severe growth defect that was partially suppressed by a deletion of RLM1, encoding the terminal transcriptional regulator of the Cell Wall Integrity MAP kinase (CWI) regulated pathway. Growth of yeast cells in the presence of sorbitol also suppressed the defect, supporting a role for VopX in destabilizing the cell wall. Expression of VopX activated expression of \u03b2-galactosidase from an RLM1-reponsive element reporter fusion, but failed to do so in cells lacking MAP kinases upstream of Rlm1. The results suggest that VopX inhibits cell growth by stimulating the CWI pathway through Rlm1. Rlm1 is an ortholog of mammalian MEF2 transcription factors that are proposed to regulate cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. The collective findings suggest that VopX contributes to disease by activating MAP kinase cascades that elicit changes in cellular transcriptional programs.", "journalVolume": "7", "journalName": "", "year": 2015, "title": "Using S. cerevisiae as a Model System to Investigate V. cholerae VopX-Host Cell Protein Interactions and Phenotypes", "venue": "Toxins", "journalPages": "4099 - 4110", "authors": [{"ids": ["4612592"], "name": "Christopher H.

Rac1 expression in bladder tissue was also evaluated. In the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rat model, three study groups were composed of control, diabetic and insulin-treated diabetic subjects. The detrusor muscle strips were suspended in organ baths at the end of 8-12 weeks after STZ injection. Carbachol (CCh) (10(-9) -10(-4) M) concentration-response curves were obtained both in the absence and in the presence of Rac1 inhibitor NSC 23766 (0.1, 1 and 10 \u03bcM). Diabetes-related histopathological changes and Rac1 expressions were assessed by haematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemical staining, respectively. CCh caused dose-dependent contractile responses in all the study groups. Rac1 inhibitor NSC 23766 inhibited CCh-induced contractile responses in all groups, but this inhibition seen in both diabetes groups was greater than in the control group. Histological examination revealed an increased bladder wall thickness both in the diabetes and in the insulin-treated diabetes groups compared to the control group. In immunohistochemical staining, expression of Rac1 was observed to be increased in all layers of bladder in both diabetic groups compared to the control group. In the diabetic bladders, increased expression of Rac1 and considerable inhibition of CCh-induced responses in the presence of NSC 23766 compared to those of the control group may indicate a specific role of Rac1 in diabetes-related bladder dysfunction, especially associated with cholinergic mediated detrusor overactivity.", "journalVolume": "116 6", "journalName": "Basic & clinical pharmacology & toxicology", "year": 2015, "title": "The Role of Rac1 on Carbachol-induced Contractile Activity in Detrusor Smooth Muscle from Streptozotocin-induced Diabetic Rats.", "venue": "Basic & clinical pharmacology & toxicology", "journalPages": "476-84", "authors": [{"ids": ["12164635"], "name": "Atiye Sinem Evcim"}, {"ids": ["6570095"], "name": "Serap Cilaker Micili"}, {"ids": ["5058214"], "name": "Meral Karaman"}, {"ids": ["3636587"], "name": "Guven Erbil"}, {"ids": ["6894133"], "name": "Ensari Guneli"}, {"ids": ["4675626"], "name": "Sedef Gidener"}, {"ids": ["4071950"], "name": "Mukaddes Gumustekin"}], "inCitations": [], "keyPhrases": [], "id": "0043ef86c071f105bebec82b5775d65aa9102776"}, {"outCitations": [], "pdfUrls": [], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0044a0338551fc8c37d1857a99e05e6fd8cdfdfe", "paperAbstract": "PURPOSE\nTo identify the disease gene in five Spanish families with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP) linked to the RP25 locus. Two candidate genes, EEF1A1 and IMPG1, were selected from the region between D6S280 and D6S1644 markers where the families are linked. The genes were selected as good candidates on the basis of their function, tissue expression pattern, and/or genetic data.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA molecular genetic study was performed on DNA extracted from one parent and one affected member of each studied family. The coding exons, splice sites, and the 5' UTR of the genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). For mutation detection, direct sequence analysis was performed using the ABI 3100 automated sequencer. Segregation of an IMPG1 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in all the families studied was analyzed by restriction enzyme digest of the amplified gene fragments.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn total, 15 SNPs were identified of which 7 were novel. Of the identified SNPs, one was insertion, two were deletions, five were intronic, six were missense, and one was located in the 5' UTR. These changes, however, were also identified in unaffected members of the families and/or 50 control Caucasians. The examined known IMPG1 SNP was not segregating with the disease phenotype but was correlating with the genetic data in all families studied.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur results indicate that neither EEF1A1 nor IMPG1 could be responsible for RP25 in the studied families due to absence of any pathogenic variants. However, it is important to notice that the methodology used in this study cannot detect larger deletions that lie outside the screened regions or primer site mutations that exist in the heterozygous state.

In order to improve the diagnostic accuracy of ferritin or sTfR as a stand-alone marker, the normal cut-off value needed to be increased by 810% and 83% respectively. Mean cell haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), using a cut-off of 32.1 g/dl, had a sensitivity of 67% and specificity of 64% for detecting iron stores deficiency.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTfR-F index incorporated the high sensitivity of sTfR, a proxy for cellular iron need, and the high specificity of ferritin, a proxy for iron stores.

One of the major tasks in using such a system is the calibration of the sensing system. This paper presents a new method by which a 2DOF structured light system can be automatically recalibrated, if and when the relative pose between the camera and the projector is changed. A distinct advantage of this method is that neither an accurately designed calibration device nor the prior knowledge of the motion of the camera or the scene is required. Several important cues for self-recalibration, including geometrical cue, illumination cue, and focus cue, are explored. The sensitivity analysis shows that high accuracy in depth value can be achieved with this calibration method.

Thus, the reuse of an existing design in the development of a fault-tolerant version thereof has the potential to reduce the overall development costs. Moreover, the automation of such a reuse yields a fault-tolerant design that is correct by construction, given that the existing design is correct. To facilitate such an automation, we present an approach, where we add three levels of faulttolerance, namely failsafe, nonmasking, and masking, to functional designs represented as state machines. Intuitively, failsafe fault-tolerance requires that safety specification is met even in the presence of faults. In the presence of faults, nonmasking fault-tolerance guarantees recovery to states from where safety and liveness specifications are satisfied. Masking fault-tolerance stipulates that (i) recovery is provided to states from where safety and liveness specifications are met, and (ii) safety specification is satisfied during such a recovery. Specifically, we present sound and complete deterministic algorithms for automated addition of (failsafe/nonmasking/masking) fault-tolerance to the functional design of concurrent programs. These polynomial-time algorithms are especially useful in model-driven development of fault-tolerant systems, where models are automatically checked and modified. We also discuss (1) the effect of distribution and safety specification model on the complexity of adding fault-tolerance, and (2) the impact of the proposed algorithms on the addition of multitolerance.", "journalVolume": "", "journalName": "", "year": 2007, "title": "Adding Fault-tolerance to State Machine-based Designs", "venue": "", "journalPages": "", "authors": [{"ids": ["10146361"], "name": "Sandeep S.

We asked whether the location of an ecotone separating grass-dominated and sparsely vegetated areas reflected only historical variation in degradation or was related to variation in inherent soil properties. We then asked whether changes in the cover and spatial organization of vegetated and bare patches assessed using repeat aerial photography reflected self-organizing dynamics unrelated to soil variation or the stable patterning of soil variation. We found that the present-day ecotone was related to a shift from more weakly to more strongly developed soils. Parts of the ecotone were stable over a 60-year period, but shifts between bare and vegetated states, as well as persistently vegetated and bare states, occurred largely in small (<40 m2) patches throughout the study area. The probability that patches were presently vegetated or bare, as well as the probability that vegetation persisted and/or established over the 60-year period, was negatively related to surface calcium carbonate and positively related to subsurface clay content. Thus, only a fraction of the landscape was susceptible to vegetation change, and the sparsely vegetated area probably featured a higher frequency of susceptible soil patches.

Up-regulation of Nkx2.5 expression by desmin suggests that desmin may contribute to cardiogenic commitment and myocardial differentiation by directly influencing the transcription of the nkx2.5 gene in cardiac progenitor cells. Here, we demonstrate that desmin activates transcription of nkx2.5 reporter genes, rescues nkx2.5 haploinsufficiency in cardiac progenitor cells, and is responsible for the proper expression of Nkx2.5 in adult cardiac side population stem cells. These effects are consistent with the temporary presence of desmin in the nuclei of differentiating cardiac progenitor cells and its physical interaction with transcription factor complexes bound to the enhancer and promoter elements of the nkx2.5 gene.

Heat exchangers and heat pipes operate at liquid-vapor saturation. We hypothesize that the wetting behavior of liquid water on microstructures surrounded by pure water vapor differs from that for water droplets in air.\n\n\nEXPERIMENTS\nThe static and dynamic contact angles and contact angle hysteresis of water droplets were measured in air and pure water vapor environments inside a pressure vessel. Pressures ranged from 60 to 1000 mbar, with corresponding saturation temperatures between 36 and 100\u00b0C. The wetting behavior was studied on four hydrophobic surfaces: flat Teflon-coated, micropillars, micro-scale meshes, and nanoparticle-coated with hierarchical micro- and nanoscale roughness.\n\n\nFINDINGS\nStatic advancing contact angles are 9\u00b0 lower in the water vapor environment than in air on a flat surface. One explanation for this reduction in contact angles is water vapor adsorption to the Teflon. On microstructured surfaces, the vapor environment has little effect on the static contact angles. In all cases, variations in pressure and temperature do not influence the wettability and mobility of the water droplets. In most cases, advancing contact angles increase and contact angle hysteresis decreases when the droplets are sliding or rolling down an inclined surface.", "journalVolume": "453", "journalName": "Journal of colloid and interface science", "year": 2015, "title": "Impact of air and water vapor environments on the hydrophobicity of surfaces.", "venue": "Journal of colloid and interface science", "journalPages": "177-185", "authors": [{"ids": ["4463041"], "name": "Patricia B.

The change of the expression of PKM\u03b6 in the ACC was measured by western blot, and the mRNA of PKM\u03b6 was detected by quantitative real-time PCR 1, 3, 7 days after experimental tooth movement. The average time spent on mouth-wiping behaviour of rats involved in pain perception was detected. After that a selective PKM\u03b6 inhibitor, called myristoylated \u03b6-pseudosubstrate inhibitory peptide (ZIP) was injected into ACC, and the effects of ZIP were evaluated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mouth-wiping behaviour of rats was significantly increased 1, 3, and 7 days after experimental tooth movement. Changes in PKM\u03b6 levels were not detected on day 1 but were found to be increased 3 days following the tooth movement, and then declined to the baseline 7 days after tooth movement in the ACC. PKM\u03b6 mRNA levels were not significantly different between the experimental and sham-treated groups at the three time points. Time spent on mouth-wiping behaviour was reduced after ZIP was injected into ACC 3 days after tooth movement, and the analgesic effect last for at least 24h.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPKM\u03b6 in the ACC acts to maintain the pain induced by experimental tooth movement. Increased expression of PKM\u03b6 protein is attributed to persistent translation of PKM\u03b6 mRNA.

We conducted a case-control study to investigate this issue.\n\n\nMETHODS\nConsecutive patients (n = 182) with acute IS were examined within 48 hours after admission to our center. A history of acute infections within 2 months before the IS was assessed by means of a specially designed questionnaire that was also given to a control group consisting of 194 consecutive patients who were seen in our outpatient clinic and had suffered IS at least 6 months previously.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe prevalence of acute infection in the study group was significantly higher (44/182 = 24.2%) than in the control group (19/194 = 9.7%; odds ratio, 2.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.64 to 5.26; P = .0002) and infection occurred mostly within 1 week before the IS (41/44). Neither the severity of the IS nor the type of the infection was significantly different in patients and control subjects.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAcute infections of different types constitute a risk factor for IS, particularly within 1 week of the event.

Energy deficiency causes depolarization of the neuronal membrane and Ca2+ enters the cells through different ion channels, the voltage-sensitive L-type Ca2+ channels and the NMDA-operated channels being the main gates. In the present study we used primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons to demonstrate that the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist nimodipine, the non-competitive NMDA antagonists dizocilpine and memantine, as well as the AMPA antagonist NBQX (2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro -7-sulfamoyl-benzo(F)quinoxaline), attenuate the glutamate-induced neuronal damage dose-dependently. Nimodipine applied simultaneously with NMDA-antagonists and NBQX, respectively, resulted in somewhat greater neuroprotection of glutamate-treated neurons compared with the effects of these agents applied singly. The type of interaction is best described by an independent action in combination, which means that the relative effects of nimodipine were not enhanced.

There was a glucose concentration dependent increase in the glycation of MIP26 which reached to 2.48 moles/mole of protein with 100 mM glucose. Gel electrophoresis showed that there was no degradation of MIP26 to MIP22 during incubation. Channel permeability was determined by reconstituting MIP26 into asolectin liposomes. There was a MIP26 glycation dependent decrease in the permeability to sucrose. Furthermore, proteoliposomes containing nonglycated MIP26 showed complete uncoupling of the channels with calmodulin whereas the channels containing glycated MIP26 were only partially uncoupled.

A number of works have addressed the problem of what is the best representation for symbolic music in this context. The tree representation, using rhythm for defining the tree structure and pitch information for leaf and node labeling has proven to be effective in melodic similarity computation. In this paper we propose a solution when we have melodies represented by trees for the training but the duration information is not available for the input data. For that, we infer a probabilistic context-free grammar using the information in the trees (duration and pitch) and classify new melodies represented by strings using only the pitch. The case study in this paper is to identify a snippet query among a set of songs stored in symbolic format.

The dose of danazol ranged between 100 and 600 mg/d. The patients were included in two groups: 1) Responders if they achieved complete or partial remission; 2) Non-responders if they achieved transient or fair response.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe overall response rate was 58.8% and in patients previously treated 46.1%. The time to response was 35.6 +/- 48.5 days (range 14-180 days).

By results of Rickard in [Ri1] and [Ri2], if A and B are derived Morita equivalent algebras over a field k, then there is a complex of bimodules T s.t. the functor T \u2297 A \u2212 : D (Mod A) \u2192 D(Mod B) is an equivalence. The complex T is called a tilting complex. When B = A the isomorphism classes of tilting complexes T form the derived Picard group DPic(A). This group acts naturally on the Grothendieck group K0(A). We prove that when the algebra A is either local or commutative, then any derived Morita equivalent algebra B is actually Morita equivalent. This enables us to compute DPic(A) in these cases. Assume A is noetherian. Dualizing complexes over A were defined in [Ye]. These are complexes of bimodules which generalize the commutative definition of [RD]. We prove that the group DPic(A) classifies the set of isomorphism classes of dualizing complexes.

Nowadays, increased computational power and the availability of open source software enable the calculation of BVP for clinical purposes. In order to illustrate the possible advantages of this approach, the explanatory power of BVP is investigated using a rectangular tank filled with an electrolytic conductor and a patient specific three dimensional model.\n\n\nMETHODS\nMRI images of the tank and of a patient were obtained in three orthogonal directions using a turbo spin echo MRI sequence. MRI images were segmented in three dimensional using custom written software. Gmsh software was used for mesh generation. BVP were computed using a transfer matrix and FEniCS software.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe solution for 240,000 nodes, corresponding to a resolution of 5 mm throughout the thorax volume, was computed in 3 minutes. The tank experiment revealed that an increased electrode surface renders the position of the 4 V equipotential plane insensitive to mesh cell size and reduces simulated deviations. In the patient-specific model, the impact of assigning a different conductivity to lung tissue on the distribution of volume potentials could be visualized.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nGeneration of high quality volume meshes and computation of BVP with a resolution of 5 mm is feasible using generally available software and hardware. Estimation of BVP may lead to an improved understanding of the genesis of BSP and sources of local inaccuracies.", "journalVolume": "20 2", "journalName": "Annals of noninvasive electrocardiology : the official journal of the International Society for Holter and Noninvasive Electrocardiology, Inc", "year": 2015, "title": "Computing volume potentials for noninvasive imaging of cardiac excitation.", "venue": "Annals of noninvasive electrocardiology : the official journal of the International Society for Holter and Noninvasive Electrocardiology, Inc", "journalPages": "132-9", "authors": [{"ids": ["8023584"], "name": "Anne-Marijn van der Graaf"}, {"ids": ["3386828"], "name": "Pranav Bhagirath"}, {"ids": ["4515276"], "name": "Vincent J H M van Driel"}, {"ids": ["4172920"], "name": "Hemanth Ramanna"}, {"ids": ["3556142"], "name": "Jacques de Hooge"}, {"ids": ["6691478"], "name": "Natasja M S de Groot"}, {"ids": ["3381459"], "name": "Marco G\u00f6tte"}], "inCitations": ["880ab596cecfeeb1221e8219260a5fe99e52cfa8"], "keyPhrases": [], "id": "0053771359cb13df205c52a0c06b6ac66c4ac343"}, {"outCitations": [], "pdfUrls": [], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0053b2488b7cadd8cd2ee87808f4b639cab2870f", "paperAbstract": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalName": "", "title": "Development of a spectrofluorometer with USB interface for in vivo measurements in surgical procedures", "venue": "", "journalPages": "", "authors": [], "inCitations": [], "keyPhrases": [], "id": "0053b2488b7cadd8cd2ee87808f4b639cab2870f"}, {"outCitations": [], "pdfUrls": [], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0053b7a7bf5f0a4e30bc38cf52960c90a4e401e8", "paperAbstract": "Nursing homes are reservoirs for antimicrobial-resistant organisms (AROs).

A recent study suggested that disulfiram, a drug used to treat alcoholism, might act as a modulator of P-glycoprotein. In this study, we investigated the molecular and chemical basis of disulfiram as a multidrug resistance modulator. We demonstrate that in intact cells, disulfiram reverses either MDR1- or MRP1-mediated efflux of fluorescent drug substrates. Disulfiram inhibits ATP hydrolysis and the binding of [alpha-32P]8-azidoATP to P-glycoprotein and MRP1, with inhibition curves comparable with those of N-ethylmaleimide, a cysteine-modifying agent. However, if the ATP sites are protected with excess ATP, disulfiram stimulates ATP hydrolysis by both transporters in a concentration-dependent manner. Thus, in addition to modifying cysteines at the ATP sites, disulfiram may interact with the drug-substrate binding site. We demonstrate that disulfiram, but not N-ethylmaleimide, inhibits in a concentration-dependent manner the photoaffinity labeling of the multidrug transporter with 125I-iodoarylazidoprazosin and [3H]azidopine. This suggests that the interaction of disulfiram with the drug-binding site is independent of its role as a cysteine-modifying agent. Finally, we have exploited MRP4 (ABCC4) to demonstrate that disulfiram can inhibit ATP binding by forming disulfide bonds between cysteines located in the vicinity of, although not in, the active site. Taken together, our results suggest that disulfiram has unique molecular interactions with both the ATP and/or drug-substrate binding sites of multiple ATP binding cassette transporters, which are associated with drug resistance, and it is potentially an attractive agent to combat multidrug resistance.", "journalVolume": "65 3", "journalName": "Molecular pharmacology", "year": 2004, "title": "The molecular basis of the action of disulfiram as a modulator of the multidrug resistance-linked ATP binding cassette transporters MDR1 (ABCB1) and MRP1 (ABCC1).", "venue": "Molecular pharmacology", "journalPages": "675-84", "authors": [{"ids": ["2778498"], "name": "Zuben E.

Here, we developed an ultrasensitive mediator-free triple-enzyme cascade electrocatalytic aptasensor for thrombin detection on the basis of exonuclease-assisted target recycling and hybridization chain reaction (HCR) amplification strategy. The double strands constructed by the hybridization of thrombin binding aptamer (S1) with its complementary strand (S2) were firstly assembled on the electrode. Upon addition of target to the system, the S1 recognized thrombin and left off electrode to make space for assembly of hybrid-primer probe (H0). Then, the H0 triggered the HCR to form the multi-functional hemin/G-quadruplex DNAzyme nanowires. In the mediator-free triple-enzyme cascade electrocatalytic amplification system, the hemin/G-quadruplex DNAzyme nanowires here simultaneously played three roles: the redox probe, NADH oxidase and HRP-mimicking DNAzyme, respectively, which effectively avoided the fussy redox probe and enzyme labeling process, serving a useful alternative or supplement to conventional assays that typically suffer from complexity and poor sensitivity. Additionally, in order to improve the assembly amount of hemin/G-quadruplex DNAzyme nanowire, the exonuclease-assisted target recycling amplification was used for the continuous removal of S1.

Several models of PPM-DOTS have been initiated under the Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP) in India, but scaling up and sustaining successful projects has remained a challenge.\n\n\nAIM\nThis paper examines factors accounting for the sustainability of a PPM-DOTS initiated in 1998 in Pimpri Chinchwad (PC), a city in Maharashtra, India.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA two-year intervention research project documented the workings of the PPM-DOTS programme. This paper draws on in-depth interviews with programme officers and staff, and semi-structured interviews with private practitioners (PP) practising in the study area.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPPM-DOTS was originally introduced in PC, in order to increase access to DOTS. Over the years it has become an integral part of the RNTCP. Multiple approaches were employed to involve and sustain private providers' participation in PPM-DOTS. Systems were developed for supervision and monitoring DOTS in the private sector. Systematic use of operations research and successful mobilisation of available local resources helped set future direction for expanding and strengthening the PPM. The private sector's contribution to case detection and treatment success has increased, however ensuring referrals of TB suspects from all private providers continues to present a challenge.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPPM-DOTS in PC is one of the few Indian models implemented as envisaged by global and national policy makers. Its successful operation for over a decade reiterates the importance of public sector initiative and leadership and makes it an interesting case for study and replication.", "journalVolume": "58 1", "journalName": "The Indian journal of tuberculosis", "year": 2011, "title": "Sustaining PPM-DOTS: the case of Pimpri Chinchwad, Maharashtra, India.", "venue": "The Indian journal of tuberculosis", "journalPages": "18-28", "authors": [{"ids": ["6009057"], "name": "Anagha Pradhan"}, {"ids": ["3622889"], "name": "Vinita Datye"}, {"ids": ["5551702"], "name": "Karina Kielmann"}, {"ids": ["13011952"], "name": "Kishor Khilare"}, {"ids": ["22604945"], "name": "Amruta Datye"}, {"ids": ["7941804"], "name": "Vikas Inamdar"}, {"ids": ["1951304"], "name": "John D.

The imaging features and cytologic findings were correlated with histologic findings.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFifty-six papillary lesions in 40 patients underwent either mastectomy, segmental duct resection, or excision biopsy. There were three papillary carcinomas, 13 papillaryal lesions with carcinoma in situ, one atypical papilloma, four sclerosed papillomata, and 35 papillomata. Of these lesions, 37.5% (21/56) and 82.1% (46/56) could be detected on mammography and sonography, respectively. Galactography and dilated ducts helped to suggest the papillary nature of the lesions.

We distinguish between urban, natural and cultural qualities as different sources of regional attractiveness and estimate their influence on the observed growth of individuals with at least three years of higher education during 2001\u20132010.

By coculturing human postnatal thymus hematopoietic progenitors and OP9-huDL1 stromal cells, we found that murine IL-7 is approximately 100-fold less potent than human IL-7 for supporting human T cell development in vitro. We investigated the role of human IL-7 in newborn BALB/c Rag2(-/-)gamma(c)(-/-) mice transplanted with human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) as an in vivo model of human hematopoiesis using three approaches to improve IL-7 signaling: administration of human IL-7, ectopic expression of human IL-7 by the transplanted human HSC, or enforced expression of a murine/human chimeric IL-7 receptor binding murine IL-7. We show that premature IL-7 signaling at the HSC stage, before entrance in the thymus, impeded T cell development, whereas increased intrathymic IL-7 signaling significantly enhanced the maintenance of immature thymocytes. Increased thymopoiesis was also observed when we transplanted BCL-2- or BCL-x(L)-transduced human HSC. Homeostasis of peripheral mature T cells in this humanized mouse model was not improved by any of these strategies.

The presence of vaginal bleeding and the duration of the ultrasound scan were noted. Ten milliliters of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was placed in the condom. Bubbling, which occurs in the presence of blood or cervicovaginal secretions, was considered a positive test. Exposure of a clean condom or coupling gel to H2O2 did not cause bubbling.

Endothelial activation and inflammation have been suggested to play an important role in the pathogenesis of cSVD. We investigated if compound scores of endothelial activation or inflammation, based on several blood markers, are associated with cognitive performance 3 years later in patients with essential hypertension.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAt baseline, levels of blood markers of endothelial activation (soluble vascular cellular adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), sP-selectin, and sE-selectin) and markers of inflammation (neopterin, C-reactive protein, and sICAM-1) were measured and transformed into compound scores using z-scores. In addition, a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to determine the presence of cSVD-related MRI markers. Three years later, patients underwent a neuropsychological assessment to determine cognitive performance.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 101 patients with hypertension were included in the present study. In multiple linear regression analyses with correction for demographics and MRI markers, the compound score of endothelial activation (B = -0.19, 95% confidence interval = -0.34 to -0.04, P = 0.014), but not of inflammation (B = -0.09, 95% confidence interval = -0.22 to 0.05, P = 0.198), was associated with worse cognitive performance.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur results show that an overall measure of endothelial activation is associated with cognitive performance in patients with essential hypertension.

Correct subtype classification is necessary for making therapeutic decisions in primary aldosteronism (PA). Therefore, we studied in detail the clinical, hormonal and histological features of this entity in two patients with A/CPAs. We describe two patients with A/CPA and present their endocrine evaluations at baseline, after suppression with fludrocortisone and dexamethasone, after therapy with spironolactone and after unilateral adrenalectomy. Moreover, the expression of corticotropin (MC2R) and angiotensin II type 1 (AT1R) receptors and 17alpha-hydroxylase in the tumors of these two patients was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Aldosterone, 18-hydroxycorticosterone (18-OH-B) and 18-hydroxycortisol (18-OH-F) were not suppressible with fludrocortisone in either patient and were partly suppressible with dexamethasone in one of the patients. Adrenal insufficiency developed in both patients after operation and lasted for more than 6 months. Aldosterone and hybrid corticosteroids returned to normal 8 weeks after adrenalectomy. In both cases, immunostaining showed weak expression of AT1R and MC2R but strong expression of 17alpha-hydroxylase. The most common germline mutations in the aldosterone synthase gene and the aldosterone synthase/11beta-hydroxylase hybrid gene were absent. These two cases document the fact that sporadic A/CPA is a subtype of PA. The presence of an A/CPA should be considered if a patient has both PA and hypercortisolism.", "journalVolume": "33 5", "journalName": "Hypertension research : official journal of the Japanese Society of Hypertension", "year": 2010, "title": "Sporadic solitary aldosterone- and cortisol-co-secreting adenomas: endocrine, histological and genetic findings in a subtype of primary aldosteronism.", "venue": "Hypertension research : official journal of the Japanese Society of Hypertension", "journalPages": "467-72", "authors": [{"ids": ["8403081"], "name": "Holger Sven Willenberg"}, {"ids": ["1982691"], "name": "Martin A.

The present study sought to establish the prevalence of psychological morbidity in the children of migrant parents from Ireland, and reasons for differences.\n\n\nMETHODS\nData from two British birth cohorts were used for analysis. Each surveyed 17 000 babies born in one week in 1958 and 1970 and followed up through childhood. Validated scales assessed psychological health.\n\n\nRESULTS\nRelative to the rest of the cohort, second-generation Irish children grew up in material hardship and showed greater psychological problems at ages 7, 11 (1958 cohort) and 16 (both cohorts). Adjusting for material adversity and maternal psychological distress markedly reduced differences. Relative to non-Irish parents, Irish-born parents were more likely to report chronic health problems (odds ratio [OR]: 1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08-1.54), and Irish-born mothers were more likely to be psychologically distressed (OR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.13-1.84, when child was 10). Effect sizes diminished once material adversity was taken into account.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSecond-generation Irish children experienced high levels of psychological morbidity, but this was accounted for through adverse material circumstances in childhood and psychological distress in parents.

We assessed if biochemical disease-free survival (DFS) is improved by adding 6 months of androgen suppression (AS; two injections of every-3-months depot of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist) to primary radiotherapy (RT) for intermediate- or high-risk localized prostate cancer.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nA total of 819 patients staged: (1) cT1b-c, with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) \u2265 10 ng/mL or Gleason \u2265 7, or (2) cT2a (International Union Against Cancer TNM 1997), with no involvement of pelvic lymph nodes and no clinical evidence of metastatic spread, with PSA \u2264 50 ng/mL, were centrally randomized 1:1 to either RT or RT plus AS started on day 1 of RT. Centers opted for one dose (70, 74, or 78 Gy). Biochemical DFS, the primary end point, was defined from entry until PSA relapse (Phoenix criteria) and clinical relapse by imaging or death of any cause. The trial had 80% power to detect hazard ratio (HR), 0.714 by intent-to-treat analysis stratified by dose of RT at the two-sided \u03b1 = 5%.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe median patient age was 70 years. Among patients, 74.8% were intermediate risk and 24.8% were high risk. In the RT arm, 407 of 409 patients received RT; in the RT plus AS arm, 403 patients received RT plus AS and three patients received RT only. At 7.2 years median follow-up, RT plus AS significantly improved biochemical DFS (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.66; P < .001, with 319 events), as well as clinical progression-free survival (205 events, HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.84; P = .001). In exploratory analysis, no statistically significant interaction between treatment effect and dose of RT could be evidenced (heterogeneity P = .79 and P = .66, for biochemical DFS and progression-free survival, respectively). Overall survival data are not mature yet.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSix months of concomitant and adjuvant AS improves biochemical and clinical DFS of intermediate- and high-risk cT1b-c to cT2a (with no involvement of pelvic lymph nodes and no clinical evidence of metastatic spread) prostatic carcinoma, treated by radiation.", "journalVolume": "34 15", "journalName": "Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology", "year": 2016, "title": "Short Androgen Suppression and Radiation Dose Escalation for Intermediate- and High-Risk Localized Prostate Cancer: Results of EORTC Trial 22991.", "venue": "Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology", "journalPages": "1748-56", "authors": [{"ids": ["2299890"], "name": "Michel Bolla"}, {"ids": ["4203359"], "name": "Philippe Maingon"}, {"ids": ["6600156"], "name": "Christian Carrie"}, {"ids": ["4325670"], "name": "Salvador Vill\u00e1"}, {"ids": ["7783072"], "name": "Petros Kitsios"}, {"ids": ["10087569"], "name": "Philip M.

The NM has been described in mouse, hamster and human spermatozoa. In this study, an NM structural component of the guinea pig sperm nucleus was obtained by removing nuclear proteins and DNA from DTT-CTAB nuclei. Removal was achieved with high ionic strength salt and microccocal nuclease treatments including a heparin treatment to cause a slight swelling of the nucleus and facilitate material extraction. Actin, myosin, cytokeratins and spectrin were detected associated to NM by indirect immunofluorescence, immunogold staining and Western blotting analysis using specific antibodies. The presence of NM in guinea pig sperm nucleus is shown for the first time and some of its components are identified.

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of MPS among chronic back pain patients, as well as to identify risk factors and the outcome of this disorder.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis was a prospective observational study involving 126 patients who attended the Pain Management Unit for chronic back pain between 1st January 2009 and 31st December 2009. Data examined included demographic features of patients, duration of back pain, muscle(s) involved, primary diagnosis, treatment modality and response to treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe prevalence of MPS among chronic back pain patients was 63.5% (n = 80). Secondary MPS was more common than primary MPS, making up 81.3% of the total MPS. There was an association between female gender and risk of developing MPS (\u03c7(2) = 5.38, P = 0.02, O.R. = 2.4). Occupation, body mass index and duration of back pain were not significantly associated with MPS occurrence. Repeated measures analysis showed significant changes (P < 0.001) in Visual Analogue Score (VAS) and Modified Oswestry Disability Score (MODS) with standard management during three consecutive visits at six-month intervals.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMPS prevalence among chronic back pain patients was significantly high, with female gender being a significant risk factor.

The strengths and shortcomings of passive sampling are assessed for water, sediments, and biota. Passive water sampling is a suitable technique for measuring concentrations of freely dissolved compounds. This method yields results that are incompatible with the EU's quality standard definition in terms of total concentrations in water, but this definition has little scientific basis. Insufficient quality control is a present weakness of passive sampling in water. Laboratory performance studies and the development of standardized methods are needed to improve data quality and to encourage the use of passive sampling by commercial laboratories and monitoring agencies. Successful prediction of bioaccumulation based on passive sampling is well documented for organisms at the lower trophic levels, but requires more research for higher levels. Despite the existence of several knowledge gaps, passive sampling presently is the best available technology for chemical monitoring of nonpolar organic compounds.

But, what are the costs of failing to do so? that is, how strong is the evidence that inflation more rapid than price stability significantly reduces economic growth? For policymakers, the measure of their success is price stability, often defined as an inflation rate that is sufficiently low, stable and predictable so as not to be a factor in private decisions. Policymakers usually equate low inflation to annual increases of 1 to 2 percent in a broad index of consumer prices, excluding food and energy, a rate that the current Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke, once dubbed the \u201coptimal long-run inflation rate.\u201d such a rate, in part, acknowledges imperfections in adjustments to the prices of existing goods for quality improvements and to the prices of new goods not previously included in the price index. the rate also reflects, in part, a cushion against the risk that an adverse economic shock might corner policymakers against the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates. the idea that price stability is a necessary condition for maximum sustained economic growth is a common theme among Federal reserve officials. at the 2005 Federal reserve Bank of kansas City policy conference honoring his service and retirement, then-Chairman alan Greenspan said, \u201ci presume maximum sustainable economic growth will continue to be our goal, with price stability pursued as a necessary condition to promote that goal.\u201d Bernanke has expressed similar views. at an october 2004 Federal reserve Bank of How ?", "journalVolume": "", "journalName": "", "year": 2006, "title": "www.stlouisfed.org Inflation\u2019s Economic Cost:", "venue": "", "journalPages": "", "authors": [], "inCitations": [], "keyPhrases": [], "id": "00668f672299a7d3337d5820bdc15dcd94aa57ec"}, {"outCitations": ["54626d11be2e12403aa99bc8bc191a882f3b9169", "cf0afe558c2638db24a0527a4725fe0ae82cc88b", "d53b7e967c713f2fc3c620144348af1d861efcf8", "31d15e69389efeda5e21adfa888dffa8018523c0", "d2f0ac7c6725dabf0d5064a6652c3c32bbb006b8", "0e6393918be5d265a6d2429f29d4c8b40085faa8"], "pdfUrls": ["http://eprint.iacr.org/eprint-bin/getfile.pl?entry=2005/068&file=068.pdf&version=20050302:195528", "http://eprint.iacr.org/2005/068", "http://eprint.iacr.org/2005/068.ps", "http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Borislav_Stoyanov/publication/220336444_N-adic_Summation-Shrinking_Generator._Basic_properties_and_empirical_evidences/links/00b7d51d99cab31aad000000.pdf", "https://eprint.iacr.org/2005/068.pdf", "http://eprint.iacr.org/2005/068.pdf"], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0066a7a06276d5da2dc5d829c9b27a8fc600a518", "paperAbstract": "The need of software-flexible stream ciphers has led to several alternative proposals in the last few years.

Using a combination of single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequencing techniques, no mutations were identified in the WT1 tumour-suppressor gene from the 11p13 region, but a novel polymorphism was identified in exon 1. mRNA expression studies using the insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) gene, located in 11p15, showed that there was no relaxation of imprinting at this locus. There was also no evidence of loss of heterozygosity on the long arm of chromosome 16.

Data for creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, and troponin T (TnT) specimens ordered during a 12-month period (6 months preintervention and 6 months postintervention) (n = 14571) was downloaded from our laboratory information system. All specimens with (1) normal TnT (ie, <0.01 ng/mL), (2) elevated CK-MB (ie, >6.6 ng/mL), and (3) elevated CK-MB index (ie, >5) were considered discrepant and independently reviewed by 2 ED clinicians for the presence of an acute coronary syndrome and for documentation of final diagnosis. Creatine kinase, CK-MB, and TnT ED volumes preintervention and postintervention were analyzed to assess laboratory cost savings.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 6444 cases included in the analysis, only 17 were discrepant. Of all 17 cases, no patients were diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome. After removing CK-MB from the templates and requisitions, CK-MB and CK volumes decreased by 80% and 76%, respectively, translating to annual reagent cost savings of approximately $47000.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCreatine kinase-MB can be removed from the routine ED test menu without adversely affecting patient care.

The pathogenesis of the infection results from the sequestration of infected erythrocytes (IRBC) in vital organs, including the brain, with resulting impairment of blood flow, hypoxia, and lactic acidosis. Sequestration occurs through the adhesion of IRBC to host receptors on microvascular endothelium by Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1), a large family of variant surface antigens, each with up to seven extracellular domains that can bind to multiple host receptors. Consequently, antiadhesive therapies directed at single endothelial adhesion molecules may not be effective. In this study, we demonstrated that the serine protease thrombin, which is pivotal in the activation of the coagulation cascade, cleaved the major parasite adhesin on the surface of IRBC. As a result, adhesion under flow was dramatically reduced, and already adherent IRBC were detached. Thrombin cleavage sites were mapped to the Duffy binding-like \u03b41 (DBL\u03b41) domain and interdomains 1 and 2 in the PfEMP1 of the parasite line IT4var19. Furthermore, we observed an inverse correlation between the presence of thrombin and IRBC in cerebral malaria autopsies of children. We investigated a modified (R67A) thrombin and thrombin inhibitor, hirugen, both of which inhibit the binding of substrates to exosite I, thereby reducing its proinflammatory properties. Both approaches reduced the barrier dysfunction induced by thrombin without affecting its proteolytic activity on PfEMP1, raising the possibility that thrombin cleavage of variant PfEMP1 may be exploited as a broadly inhibitory antiadhesive therapy.\n\n\nIMPORTANCE\nPlasmodium falciparum malaria is the third leading cause of mortality due to a pathogen, with 214 million people infected and 438,000 deaths annually. The adhesion of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (IRBC) to microvascular endothelium is a major pathological process in severe malaria. While the recent implementation of artemisinin-based antimalarial therapy for severe malaria improves patient survival by targeting all parasite stages, antiparasite drugs alone may not immediately reverse pathophysiological processes in occluded vessels. Here we show that thrombin, an enzyme intimately involved in the clotting process, cleaves the main parasite adhesin expressed on the surface of IRBC, thereby preventing and reversing the binding of IRBC to endothelial cells. This beneficial effect of thrombin can be achieved by modified thrombins that cause significantly less clotting and vessel leakage while preserving the ability to cleave the parasite protein.

This selectivity is ecologically relevant. During scanning for food birds spot the surroundings mainly with the monocular lateral visual field of the one or other eye and then control pecking with their small binocular frontal visual field. As the visual systems of the avian left and right brain hemisphere are supposed to work largely independently in the short term, the problem arises of how the avian brain handles a task that requires coordinated activity of the left and right brain hemisphere for efficient processing. Here we report that chicks exhibit strong selective feeding when both of the brain hemispheres are involved. With the left or right hemisphere alone selectivity is reduced or completely absent. Our findings reveal a marked qualitative difference between unilateral and bilateral processing.

There is a need to update this evidence given the changing nature of sedentary behaviour and continued interest in this field. This review aims to assist researchers in better interpreting the diversity of findings concerning sedentary behaviour and weight status.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo provide an update of the associations between sedentary behaviour and dietary intake across the lifespan.\n\n\nMETHODS\nElectronic databases searched were MEDLINE, PsychInfo, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Science Direct for publications between January 2010 and October 2013, thus updating a previous review. Included were observational studies assessing an association between at least one sedentary behaviour and at least one aspect of dietary intake in preschool children (<5 years), school-aged children (6-11 years), adolescents (12-18 years) and adults (>18 years).\n\n\nRESULTS\n27 papers met inclusion criteria (preschool k=3, school-aged children k=9, adolescents k=15, adults k=3). For all three groups of young people, trends were evident for higher levels of sedentary behaviour, especially TV viewing, to be associated with a less healthful diet, such as less fruit and vegetable and greater consumption of energy-dense snacks and sugar sweetened beverages. Data for the three studies with adults were less conclusive.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSedentary behaviour continues to be associated with unhealthy diet in young people in mostly cross-sectional studies. More studies utilising a prospective design are needed to corroborate findings and more studies are needed with adults.", "journalVolume": "49 18", "journalName": "British journal of sports medicine", "year": 2015, "title": "Sedentary behaviour and diet across the lifespan: an updated systematic review.", "venue": "British journal of sports medicine", "journalPages": "1179-88", "authors": [{"ids": ["21043742"], "name": "Matthew Hobbs"}, {"ids": ["2939325"], "name": "Natalie Pearson"}, {"ids": ["25695675"], "name": "Perry J Foster"}, {"ids": ["4475815"], "name": "Stuart J H Biddle"}], "inCitations": ["134cad7f311acc90f4f4a54e60e216e35c9cfb93", "5b9c77cbf58bc72e6058071adfd3084c3b250c20", "229c67af31fb2dc1ec8c58ec950c661e10122854", "0d1289e8be28ab02c44c124be3e31c795400c981", "cccce7830342229010e7e133a38e9b8cfde2ca61", "3e44805e4fa5ef7dadc08b885cacd4ff2a522149", "56b0d7612a41531c7791a77a7aac685ab368df31", "43c61500970610070b017ab441ffd356759764ec", "1cf9cf7b108feff973061fbade9f854c6819b7a7", "ad1d10358b8b5929792149d01d49890fb1797345", "46d586e1c88a8b7d5e11868a16b205e16f74f55f"], "keyPhrases": [], "id": "006e8e6658c2dce1bbbbd26f9e68f89580c4b78f"}, {"outCitations": [], "pdfUrls": [], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/006ea575ed16f35b45ac3e339f4e49be2598b3b3", "paperAbstract": "A 39-year-old man and Jehova's Witness suffered a complex pelvic fracture in an accident at work.

Such flows are the base states for various three-dimensional instabilities; the periodically shedding two-dimensional circular cylinder wake with three-dimensional modes A and B being the generic example. However, it is not easy to physically realize the ideal flows owing to the presence of end effects and finite spanwise geometries. Flows past rings are sometimes advanced as providing a relevant idealization, but in fact these have symmetry group O(2) and only approach Z2 \u00d7 O(2) symmetry in the infinite aspect ratio limit. The present work examines physically realizable periodically driven annular cavity flows that possess Z2 \u00d7 O(2) spatio-temporal symmetry. The flows have three distinct codimension-1 instabilities: two synchronous modes (A and B), and two manifestations of a quasi-periodic (QP) mode, either as modulated standing waves or modulated travelling waves. It is found that the curvature of the system can determine which of these modes is the first to become unstable with increasing Reynolds number, and that even in the nonlinear regime near onset of three-dimensional instabilities the dynamics are dominated by mixed modes with complicated spatio-temporal structure.

Results revealed that at 2 hours after cerebral contusion and laceration injury, aquaporin 4 expression significantly increased, brain water content and blood-brain barrier permeability increased, and the number of pinocytotic vesicles in cerebral microvascular endothelial cells increased. In addition, the mitochondrial accumulation was observed. As contusion and laceration injury became aggravated, aquaporin 4 expression continued to increase, brain water content and blood-brain barrier permeability gradually increased, brain capillary endothelial cells and astrocytes swelled, and capillary basement membrane injury gradually increased.

Since conventional cardiac Troponin assays have a low sensitivity for diagnosing AMI in the first hours after myocardial necrosis, high-sensitive assays have been developed. The aim of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of a high-sensitive Troponin T assay (hsTnT), alone or combined with the heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP) assay in comparison with the conventional cardiac Troponin (cTnT) assay for the diagnosis of AMI in patients presenting to the hospital with chest pain.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe performed a cost-utility analysis (quality adjusted life years-QALYs) and a cost effectiveness analysis (life years gained-LYGs) based on a decision analytic model, using a health care perspective in the Dutch context and a life time time-horizon. The robustness of model predictions was explored using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFor a life time incremental cost of 30.70 Euros, use of hsTnT over conventional cTnT results in gain of 0.006 Life Years and 0.004 QALY. It should be noted here that hsTnT is a diagnostic intervention which costs only 4.39 Euros/test more than the cTnT test. The ICER generated with the use of hsTnT based diagnostic strategy comparing with the use of a cTnT-based strategy, is 4945 Euros per LYG and 7370 Euros per QALY. The hsTnT strategy has the highest probability of being cost effective at thresholds between 8000 and 20000 Euros per QALY. The combination of hsTnT and h-FABP strategy's probability of being cost effective remains lower than hsTnT at all willingness to pay thresholds.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur analysis suggests that hsTnT assay is a very cost effective diagnostic tool relative to conventional TnT assay. Combination of hsTnT and H-FABP does not offer any additional economic and health benefit over hsTnT test alone.", "journalVolume": "14", "journalName": "", "year": 2014, "title": "High-sensitive Troponin T assay for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction: an economic evaluation", "venue": "BMC cardiovascular disorders", "journalPages": "77 - 77", "authors": [{"ids": ["6344736"], "name": "Anil C Vaidya"}, {"ids": ["2940761"], "name": "Johan L.

A bound on the worst-case parameter estimation error is derived. This bound shows that the worst-case parameter estimation error decreases to zero as the bound on the noise is decreased to zero. 1. Introduction THE LEAST SQUARES ALGORITHM, due to Gauss, is one of the most widely used algorithms in science. It has been extensively studied and used for parametric system identification-see, for example, the book by Ljung (1987). It is very well known that the least squares algorithm enjoys certain optimality properties under suitable stochastic assumptions about exogeneous noise. In contrast, some recent papers have taken a worst-case deterministic approach to identification. See the recent paper by Khargonekar (1993) for a discussion of this general area and an extensive list of references. In particular, our work is most closely related to the work on time-domain worst-case identification problems (Chen et al. and the references cited in these papers). Our work has grown out of a need to make connections between the classical identification theory and the more recent work in the area of robust identification. Towards this goal, in this paper we have investigated the performance of the least squares algorithm in the presence of worst-case bounded noise. In the result of this paper, we derive a bound on the worst-case parameter estimation error using the least squares algorithm in the presence of arbitrary bounded noise. This error bound shows that if the input is chosen to be a pseudorandom binary sequence, the worst-case parameter estimation error decreases to zero as the noise bound decreases to zero. In the terminology introduced by Helmicki et al. (1991), the least squares algorithm is robustly convergent. [We note that there is an important technical difference between the notion of robust convergence used in this paper and that in Heimicki et al. (1991).] While the problem formulation is motivated from the deterministic worst-case identification theory, the techniques employed in this paper draw upon the results in classical identification theory (Ljung, 1987). These results are similar in spirit to those in Wahlberg and Ljung (1992).", "journalVolume": "29", "journalName": "Automatica", "year": 1993, "title": "The least squares algorithm, parametric system identification and bounded noise", "venue": "Automatica", "journalPages": "1535-1540", "authors": [{"ids": ["1701107"], "name": "H\u00fcseyin Ak\u00e7ay"}, {"ids": ["1759103"], "name": "Pramod P.

DPD activity is highly variable in cancer populations, and this variation may influence the antitumor efficacy of 5-fluorouracil. However, little is known about the regulation of DPD mRNA expression in any tissues. Using a reverse transcription competitive PCR assay, we quantified DPD mRNA levels in 10 matched colorectal tumors and adjacent normal mucosae and 7 colorectal liver metastases and adjacent normal livers. Lower levels of DPD mRNA expression were observed in colorectal tumor compared with adjacent normal colon mucosa (median, 0.01 versus 0.37 amole/microg total RNA, P = 0.02). DPD mRNA expression was also lower in metastases than adjacent normal liver tissue (median, 0.11 versus 1.17 amole/microg total RNA, P = 0.001). DPD mRNA expression was higher in normal liver than normal colonic mucosa (median, 1.17 versus 0.37 amole/microg total RNA, P = 0.02).

Consequently, there is a pressing need for restoring the structural and functional properties of diseased articular cartilage. Yet the search for the right combination of proper target cells and growth factors for cartilage regeneration remains challenging. In this study, we first tested the intrinsic chondrogenic differentiation ability of human perivascular stem cells (hPSCs), a novel source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from human adipose tissue. A putative prochondrogenic growth factor, NEL-like molecule-1 (NELL-1), was added to the hPSC pellets to upregulate gene expression of chondrogenic markers, including AGGRECAN, COLLAGEN II, and COMP. Furthermore, the addition of NELL-1 to a transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGF-\u03b23) + bone morphogenetic protein-6 (BMP-6) \"cocktail\" resulted in the best combinatorial stimulation in accelerating the chondrogenic differentiation of hPSCs, as evidenced by increased gene and protein expression of chondrogenic markers in a shortened induction time without elevating expression of hypertrophic, fibrotic, and osteogenic markers. Mechanistically, this acceleration rendered by NELL-1 may be partially attributed to NELL-1's upregulation of BMP receptors and TGF-\u03b2 receptor type I in hPSCs for increased responsiveness to BMPs + TGF-\u03b2s. In conclusion, lipoaspirate-derived hPSCs present a novel and abundant cell source of MSCs for cartilage regeneration, and the combinatorial application of NELL-1, TGF-\u03b23, and BMP-6 with hPSCs may remarkably enhance and accelerate cartilage repair.", "journalVolume": "22 3-4", "journalName": "Tissue engineering.

With inspiration from ecology theory, these data were analysed guided by a theoretical model based on a continuum of symbiotic effects, from antagonism to mutualism.\n\n\nFINDINGS\nThe era of Swedish integrated health care started in the 1990s, when a kind of clinical network called chains of care was launched. At the beginning the chain of care development was predominantly surrounded by non-integrative conditions, which had a restraining effect on these efforts. Even so, it seems that chains of care are here to stay. This faith in chains of care can to some extent be explained by the crucial role they have as connectors in the emerging local health care systems. Thus, these systems need chains of care to evolve and chains of care seem to require the integrative framework of local health care to progress and endure. Integrated health care performance could be troublesome, unless such mutualistic conditions are in place. States of commensalism may also be promoted, but the advantages are unilateral and therefore there is a risk of disloyalty by the unaffected part, which, in turn, can create a breeding-ground for an antagonistic liaison.\n\n\nORIGINALITY/VALUE\nA theoretical approach founded on what may be called \"Health Care System Ecology\" appears to enhance the understanding of the complex logic of integrated health care.", "journalVolume": "24 4", "journalName": "Journal of health organization and management", "year": 2010, "title": "Mutualism and antagonism within organisations of integrated health care.", "venue": "Journal of health organization and management", "journalPages": "396-411", "authors": [{"ids": ["5480155"], "name": "Bengt \u00c5hgren"}], "inCitations": ["55bc5734b6dae3227b2e36cd44c57d31cea016e7", "3c2cb5a65f2e37ac7745351b0b5d65b1c4437457", "44ed39a9a5f15ff6c26440fcfcaf1c7440b7d21a", "a87a8cbcc7e75b2a8e9a1a23790d5b94acb48cb9"], "keyPhrases": [], "id": "00741301a10f329ae614a99f717f6fdf583dd75f"}, {"outCitations": [], "pdfUrls": [], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/007426c134f763ddd09bb11a37208dcf39b5bde4", "paperAbstract": "OBJECTIVES\nThe aim of the current study was to evaluate the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on cold pain perception in healthy individuals.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAnodal, cathodal (2\u2009mA), or sham tDCSs were applied on the primary motor cortex of 22 healthy subjects in a random order. A cold pressor test was performed ten minutes after initiation of stimulation. Pain threshold and tolerance were defined as time latencies to the onset of pain perception and to the withdrawal from cold stimulus, respectively. Furthermore, pain intensity (on a scale from 0 to 10) was rated at tolerance.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTime latencies to pain threshold and tolerance were altered by the type of stimulation (p < 0.05).

Lysosomal membrane stability (LMS), a sensitive biomarker of impaired health status in this organism, was assessed in the digestive glands. In addition, oxidative stress markers and the expression of mRNAs encoding proteins involved in antioxidant defense (catalase (cat) and glutathione-S-transferase (gst)) and the heat shock response (hsp90, hsp70, and hsp27) were evaluated in the gills, the target tissue of soluble chemicals. Finally, cAMP levels, which represent an important cell signaling pathway related to oxidative stress and the response to temperature challenges, were also determined in the gills. Exposure to heat stress as well as to OTC rendered a decrease in LMS and an increase in malonedialdehyde accumulation (MDA). CAT activity was not significantly modified, whereas GST activity decreased at 24\u00b0C. Cat and gst expression levels were reduced in animals kept at 24\u00b0C compared to 16\u00b0C in the presence or absence of OTC. At 16\u00b0C, treatment with OTC caused a significant increase in cat and gst transcript levels. Hsp27 mRNA was significantly up-regulated at all conditions compared to controls at 16\u00b0C. cAMP levels were increased at 24\u00b0C independent of the presence of OTC. PCA analysis showed that 37.21% and 25.89% of the total variance was explained by temperature and OTC treatment, respectively.

The three assays showed comparable analytical performance. We tested clinical utility in sera from 135 healthy subjects with and without thyroxine-binding abnormalities and in 61 patients with and without thyroidal illnesses. We found significant differences for FT4 measured by different assays in sera from the same euthyroid patients. To explain the differences, we studied the influence of temperature on performance and calibration. Most important was the neglected fact that the association constant for the binding of thyroxine to thyroxine-binding globulin decreases when the temperature rises from 20 to 37 degrees C, causing a doubling of FT4. The two-step assays, if performed at room temperature without a well-defined calibration, can give misleading FT4 concentrations. This is the case when sera from patients with thyroxine-binding abnormalities are measured against kit standards, made up in normal human sera. If an assay is to reflect the in vivo FT4 concentration at body temperature in all types of samples, it should be performed at body temperature. For practical reasons 37 degrees C is recommended, and reference values should be defined at 37 degrees C.

Handover becomes one of the major problems in such a mobile environment as it is of utmost importance to provide a higher guarantee that the users are able to continue their service during the entire length of the transmission, without it being blocked during the handover or loss of quality or data. Careful dimensioning of the network and the underlying teletraffic analysis plays a major role in determining the various Grade of Service (GoS) parameters that service providers can provide at various network loads. The channel holding time of a cell is one of the major parameters that needs to be accurately modelled in the teletraffic analysis. This paper focuses on using Phase-type distributions of Generalised Erlang form to model channel holding time in a mobile environment. We also present the Quasi-BirthDeath process, which characterises the queuing models with Generalised Erlang service and exponential interarrival distributions.

Critically analysing the ways in which policy language constructs and represents policy problems is important as these discursive constructions have implications for how we are invoked to think about (and justify) possible policy responses.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTaking the case of Australia's National Drug Strategies, this paper used an approach informed by critical discourse analysis theory and aspects of Bacchi's (2009) 'What's the Problem Represented to be' framework to critically explore how drug policy problems are constructed and represented through the language of drug policy documents over time.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOur analysis demonstrated shifts in the ways that drugs have been 'problematised' in Australia's National Drug Strategies. Central to these evolving constructions was the increasing reliance on evidence as a way of 'knowing the problem'. Furthermore, by analysing the stated aims of the policies, this case demonstrates how constructing drug problems in terms of 'drug-related harms' or alternately 'drug use' can affect what is perceived to be an appropriate set of policy responses. The gradual shift to constructing drug use as the policy problem altered the concept of harm minimisation and influenced the development of the concepts of demand- and harm-reduction over time.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese findings have implications for how we understand policy development, and challenge us to critically consider how the construction and representation of drug problems serve to justify what are perceived to be acceptable responses to policy problems. These constructions are produced subtly, and become embedded slowly over decades of policy development. National drug policies should not merely be taken at face value; appreciation of the construction and representation of drug problems, and of how these 'problematisations' are produced, is essential.", "journalVolume": "25 1", "journalName": "The International journal on drug policy", "year": 2014, "title": "Examining the construction and representation of drugs as a policy problem in Australia's National Drug Strategy documents 1985-2010.", "venue": "The International journal on drug policy", "journalPages": "81-7", "authors": [{"ids": ["13931201"], "name": "Kari Lancaster"}, {"ids": ["4542748"], "name": "Alison Ritter"}], "inCitations": ["26c133671bd58ba70e409fea8aa13be69b8acab5", "6e126158866b114f671b6d8126e2cac567184d6e", "078f8eee8a3b4c4eaeb9834be37822875bf7b672", "b1e5672ce0b6d29af10aaaffafce891eb0f5ca3a", "4e5ebb9879c8047712adf45f061a82e56ab83bcf"], "keyPhrases": [], "id": "00789344f59d6dc7faf49de208127a956901c165"}, {"outCitations": ["cd4b60aea2d3d43730eaf88ca7c5a393fc8cde9f", "445318f21f21ecf7a7bc94b18952786bf18fe92f", "27a9e0ba549bfdfb173a7d4dc8f1a5d75da5ea2c", "cdac3fc9d979b62c53869d38a47794f5e8de2005", "1181d40208486f59b65ddfb548d656f8b4f22f26", "fc33987632a5df650795c9c3daea93e2845fc97e", "eea6c206569841d021c24618fe4f41a9067ae1f5", "ea8e7f07d5a94a1e2717812a19f89d9a4a9a6246", "70a1fd64e9a04e5315d20576f947d8756a386a34", "3f7139e0bf9c926d960ca7e70685aa11a83099c5", "2e60cc65254f0ce1605a650359ad52c4e5343269", "ad5ea42dbad75b9bc643904f81aea1de101d284b", "5de440f8a4bb4caacbe7ac4d25d9c77498c5adc3", "dd205b766f94d8205f455ba108dad92dc0eed58c", "b03e97b6bcc4fedbfb995106a54ab761d0f18fd8", "a1a92339aef76219f5dd2697345f1e62dff74693", "b6f128792740e0b8c6e8b0b23276483cda3a987a", "2080b809752de3563ca04c5d2a22a2fc94e66a4c", "0ea00f4476f84701c4925522f43052aa9ae86705", "79015dff186f32aadce82e1a724eb55c4cd7f475", "45237380f4c32f624d719b282bde8eab3bd995d8", "d93a2326054a52e14febc3d168259bc85c7b819b", "0b518ad80d5a330d4b376cdb666fad07d306f896", "377952576292874f7b50227bb8727709818294fc", "41286d5e4f76b38b5dea59b7ab85e4c2fcf8ee3b", "68258866693359fe68780a50b96a37dfb95b9efc", "584785b2cf27cae60e973cfb9fd47d7613e7f831", "b2f1935728c9029b387945accc6de7832a6dfc49", "c4b65c993436707c3b7bf709c45e5963e2d29921", "f783493d86a35c3829bddb5179b3221fe18395e8", "58f1cfae0c1b4a30c66d165c02109ac4c1ebfd64", "4e762aceb2f97a7bb777f67ec104158c2c8589cd", "1adf9fd84308d43b32aafd28c8560471f7c60a35", "354b3226ee684f9b90cf608136c0b91895dc6f85", "8d4380822259601cb12a53246a2ab55839b52528", "05f7d01e15b8dbfda330abd6e3912609a6b7e16d", "cce48f69e2f500b92db7c65eae50bfcfbfb4a22c", "ad6d0ee28398bafad81bda58d66899e76636e5fd", "0322ae5074c2cabb16ef7e4df5810cc3b411784b", "7ef604e1b6453711609004d983cba5086f2cb1ec", "33e21576606a9db0d8b9fcdf02e380d5e891d943"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.jimmunol.org/content/jimmunol/183/10/6667.full.pdf?with-ds=yes", "http://www.jimmunol.org/content/jimmunol/183/10/6667.full.pdf"], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0078b941246c74f8fc79fd112df6e9417a9a5cc1", "paperAbstract": "The apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii expands during acute infection via a cycle of invasion, intracellular replication, and lytic egress. Physiological regulation has not yet been demonstrated for either invasion or egress. We now report that, in contrast to cell culture systems, in which egress occurs only after five or more parasite divisions (2-3 days), intracellular residence is strikingly abbreviated in inflammatory cells in vivo, and early egress (after zero to two divisions) is the dominant parasite fate in acutely infected mice. Adoptive transfer experiments demonstrate rapid, reciprocal, kinetically uniform parasite transfer between donor and recipient compartments, with a t(1/2) of approximately 3 h. Inflammatory macrophages are major participants in this cycle of lytic egress and reinfection, which drives rapid macrophage turnover. Inflammatory triggering cells, principally macrophages, elicit egress in infected target macrophages, a process we term externally triggered egress (ETE). The mechanism of ETE does not require reactive oxygen or nitrogen species, the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, or a variety of signal transduction mediators, but is dependent on intracellular calcium and is highly sensitive to SB203580, an inhibitor of p38 MAPK as well as a related parasite-encoded kinase. SB203580 both inhibited the initiation of ETE and altered the progression of egress.

In this study we have investigated the cerebral perfusion patterns at rest in ESRD patients on hemodialysis, compared with those in healthy volunteers. We have also studied the brain responses evoked by experimental itch induction in ESRD, after stimulating the two distinct histamine and cowhage itch pathways, and compared them with the responses evoked in healthy volunteers. To identify potential structural alterations in ESRD patients compared with a group of age-matched healthy volunteers, we calculated the density of gray matter for the entire brain using a voxel-based morphometric analysis. Our results indicated that gray matter density was significantly reduced in ESRD patients in the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital cortices, as well as in the S1, precuneus, and insula, whereas the brain stem, hippocampus, amygdala, midcingulate cortex, and nucleus accumbens displayed an increased gray matter density. Functionally, we found a significantly higher brain perfusion at baseline associated with ESRD pruritus in the anterior cingulate, insula, claustrum, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens. The brain responses evoked by cowhage itch, which are mediated by protease-activated receptors (PAR2), displayed significant differences compared with responses in healthy individuals and were correlated with perceived itch intensity in a dual, complex manner. The inverse correlations in particular suggested that a negative feedback mechanism modulated itch intensity, when elicited in a preexistent chronic itch background.", "journalVolume": "112 7", "journalName": "Journal of neurophysiology", "year": 2014, "title": "Voxel-based morphometry and arterial spin labeling fMRI reveal neuropathic and neuroplastic features of brain processing of itch in end-stage renal disease.", "venue": "Journal of neurophysiology", "journalPages": "1729-38", "authors": [{"ids": ["2331218"], "name": "Alexandru D.

The content of Ph-\u03b2-CD incorporated in monolithic matrix by the \"one-pot\" approach was ca. 2.9 times higher than that by postmodification method. The permeability of the Ph-\u03b2-CD-silica chiral hybrid monolithic column was 3.63 \u00d7 10(-14) m(2), and the minimum plate height was 12 \u03bcm corresponding to 83,300 theoretical plates/meter. Enantioseparations of 13 racemates were achieved by the Ph-\u03b2-CD-silica hybrid monolithic column. In this work, since the prepolymerization system mainly consisted of organic solvent (methanol (MeOH), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)), the limitation and difficulty of the use of water insoluble organic monomers in the previously reported \"one-pot\" method was circumvented. Therefore, various \u03b2-CD derivatives as well as other hydrophobic monomers could thus be used to prepare organic-silica hybrid monolithic columns with the \"one-pot\" process.", "journalVolume": "83 9", "journalName": "Analytical chemistry", "year": 2011, "title": "Preparation of perphenylcarbamoylated \u03b2-cyclodextrin-silica hybrid monolithic column with \"one-pot\" approach for enantioseparation by capillary liquid chromatography.", "venue": "Analytical chemistry", "journalPages": "3616-22", "authors": [{"ids": ["10693694"], "name": "Zhenbin Zhang"}, {"ids": ["9824498"], "name": "Minghuo Wu"}, {"ids": ["4281352"], "name": "Ren'an Wu"}, {"ids": ["1719060"], "name": "Jing Dong"}, {"ids": ["6292461"], "name": "Junjie Ou"}, {"ids": ["3694471"], "name": "Hanfa Zou"}], "inCitations": ["34cdb351e546a4eb5b9336c7180284c8b83aa36d", "c2cd6b9f3cab433e64b5c0356cd97a838cf38eee", "3237e2f926143b15e2940c42ea878b7271eca419"], "keyPhrases": [], "id": "007b03a0758fb8d437267682b37dc581a414d8d6"}, {"outCitations": [], "pdfUrls": [], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/007be363c54d793cff4ab638880a22a456f7780a", "paperAbstract": "PURPOSE\nWe attempted to prove if alternating chemoprophylactic and immunoprophylactic instillations improved efficacy and decreased toxicity in patients with recurrent superficial bladder cancer.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nA total of 188 patients with rapidly recurring stage Ta or T1 cancer was randomly treated with mitomycin C (group 1) or alternating mitomycin C and Pasteur strain bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) instillations (group 2) for 2 years.

The biological function of this post-translational modification has remained enigmatic. 3-nitro-L-tyrosine (nitrotyrosine, NO(2)Tyr), can be incorporated into detyrosinated alpha-tubulin instead of tyrosine, producing irreversibly nitrotyrosinated alpha-tubulin. To gain insight into the possible function of detyrosination, the effect of NO(2)Tyr has been assessed in two plant model organisms (rice and tobacco). NO(2)Tyr causes a specific, sensitive, and dose-dependent inhibition of cell division that becomes detectable from 1 h after treatment and which is not observed with non-nitrosylated tyrosine. These effects are most pronounced in cycling tobacco BY-2 cells, where the inhibition of cell division is accompanied by a stimulation of cell length, and a misorientation of cross walls. NO(2)Tyr reduces the abundance of the detyrosinated form of alpha-tubulin whereas the tyrosinated alpha-tubulin is not affected. These findings are discussed with respect to a model where NO(2)Tyr is accepted as substrate by TTL and subsequently blocks TTC activity. The irreversibly tyrosinated alpha-tubulin impairs microtubular functions that are relevant to cell division in general, and cell wall deposition in particular.", "journalVolume": "61", "journalName": "", "year": 2010, "title": "Plant cell division is specifically affected by nitrotyrosine", "venue": "Journal of experimental botany", "journalPages": "901 - 909", "authors": [{"ids": ["19062276"], "name": "A.

These problems usually stem from a lack of consistent semantics (i.e. different interpretations of geospatial concepts), heterogeneity of data formats and systems as well as a reluctance to share data, amongst others. However, SDI is about communication and sharing of spatial data and information [2], which has largely been addressed by recent intiatives such as the OGC Sensor Web Enablement [3]. The ability to discover and access sensor data over the Web is only part of the problem. The processing and extracting of relevant information from this data and building applications that use this information poses a further problem.

Profiles have been derived from these homologous sequences. Frequent structures conserve hydrophobic cores only while rare ones are sensitive to surface mutations as well. Shape space covering, i.e., the ability to transform any structure into most others with few point mutations, is very unlikely. It is concluded that many characteristic features of the sequence-to-structure map of real proteins, such as the dominance of few folds, can be explained by the simple HP model. In analogy to protein families, nets are dense and well separated in sequence space. Potential implications in better understanding the evolution of proteins and applications to improving database searches are discussed.", "journalVolume": "73 5", "journalName": "Biophysical journal", "year": 1997, "title": "How are model protein structures distributed in sequence space?", "venue": "Biophysical journal", "journalPages": "2393-403", "authors": [{"ids": ["1771889"], "name": "Erich Bornberg-Bauer"}], "inCitations": ["6498fb3c639fa5c27e968cb11ec0518b96522f4d", "2651e392f6b828e718c565dd9f89ccdb60079311", "132717870361731ab0c1e1040d0a274ea05ff283", "800e0a07c29d80bbcd80671eeaf8f03a0ce8ab55", "8db6048770707ea6fb5de5362bc3eccbef39e489", "09aa564363e1f2c38ecb5269f6d8039a56b89d1e", "93c72cd7bfcbba8e5b7a417e96b8f5d49e6bf966", "4359377c98387eb828fcd1cf07128b6ed081d2e3", "16aff53ac0061dd00017abab28e3e9cc9bda53b3", "4442d1eaaa45cd2a7a18021c35039d77169a33c3", "5971838e61ba089a226b01b4e9dc70487070be51", "2c008bf78e652765b4730d6f775ecb642327bc0e", "223a1119e23626e1f20405e9177bc8d8cd7d7d03", "274785b54e95ef4c7bc593c78a05536858d3a535", "14efbd38f6aa0260ccfddb00ae69be7fd4144f03", "d4614e822851339bcfc7e3362af09894abce0bb4", "63d4135096d8b992dead8b691f49f8558785877d", "ab593f230399af5278c57d283ba9939022608a3b", "bbb8e9a2fec644235ee1104e6503b279a3fcac55", "e01f4c7a321fd5323b4a989e1ab515e70423e5b0", "0f0d83ac43438da950e2638e79369d9f4d7f5a34", "1aeec6b8cd61361c07f135988605135fd445f050", "06c42a18e4bc6418268b66d8a0145e34b7cf2a97", "e4f970fa72ac858cd8678e376378d77d078138f3", "0a1e5befeefb48d896edc88eef0a044346c302bd", "c076b9a8cb5fecc101628e5a689718347a3fb1c4", "8bba1b9bcd400b009c0fb02f1bcf602964d27b9c", "118dfe30f4d3fc854f26e96518ed3c28f1b33613", "577d30a64289f0c91ab4386ad1994d57b1f0d857", "553a6af85b1c5a08f6a2299b927f5fa1eba06f88", "06bd21f1ed5ed19f147bc12e8537f58adb858101", "70c0f9e60d1f6a972bb596541ad3eecc72d3af9c", "1453b6ea9cd18ef454cdfc0cf72494d72377685a", "5e1067a29ab70f51108f56228bbe3e083c511c98", "1b7d69723dd6ba87f8f59f6f1e2992a5fc78381c", "1cc383136b123e83171f76fdc48b1f19b01b12bd", "8cc3700f1a81bb3cf748ae262d25c87700faa614", "1c743c8992ac332d38e91375c7fa77dc66b5db89", "3b5ae6eb496cba522baa3729061604b4324dfd16", "9f8f9f718528af97c4230f3d9fb2b8211bd586b5", "600ed5611db5f80975a893b6319f1068a86bca21", "629e45b3ce5c4e578426e13006cdb3dd258b2059", "5e931b1a2c8f51efc53eedf6e2164dcf2f84081d", "4a5f8e24e04b903b4b33881145da00495e76da78", "3df0453503b6736acf335d58f2127333afeab086", "d49a1868b641b040c26f239dd3f408186b1df580", "2a27ada5b22d1888f83d26297f669d6d589fe6e6", "17641b8bbe577cbaba077735b85625ede6426ce6", "fa15a59f02e0de68c842858fad91ef5beee5be8e", "00981ec624ba05df111f6a3f64567b3898ddd5a7", "d4f07af7bdce19d17fa9fa103cec05d0497a4d42", "4bdf5371b5b9a9e72ce32573d755a106c5719590", "753204e6f28c148219a1bc1e2139e8fe4960b88c", "1aced9a843c4ebbd0edd8104772d2e2fc348a215", "97fee7f802b545da4d6d639fede9bb1a0b39ce40", "ac45cbb6f9deb6608c0eb08426aaa1455e2065f0"], "keyPhrases": [], "id": "007e027abf6cf49ee9c76372eb2f83df284331c5"}, {"outCitations": ["2a4c0195f07eebfb18e97bed4dd35b8b167e71fe", "4247800b0e7ab7d2d6113807314d19bdbccc22e7", "1af3256e44c2e4eda8073192f7795c6201a087de", "446c65ebc6b7990597d405daa2247b2206b5eb14", "a9e2cea10189896c415f40e33b9417db6a01c410", "2404a413d900352eb2a87774210bc1ba009600d1", "ff4680c55c8724f2e3fb33b68b1cfc542b33ce34", "44ff6701d0ca7685b4d51f153ef8888fe2c2de2d", "44ace389be0a7103ec8c11a5b564e1012ac36fde"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.mri.mq.edu.au/~rdale/publications/papers/aaai97.ps.Z", "http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~rdale/publications/papers/1997/aaai97.pdf", "http://clt.mq.edu.au/~rdale/publications/papers/1997/aaai97.pdf", "http://www.comp.mq.edu.au/~rdale/publications/papers/1997/aaai97.pdf", "http://www.ics.mq.edu.au/~rdale/publications/papers/1997/aaai97.pdf"], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/007e16923acdaff7e292a04ef8896e2e847ba7e4", "paperAbstract": "A very common metaphor used when discussing the World Wide Web, and hypertextual systems in general, is that of navigation within a space. An alternative metaphor is to view a session with any such system as a dialogue or conversation. This potentially richer metaphor acknowledges the interactive nature of the experience, and may open up new ways of thinking about how the medium can be used. Unfortunately, existing hypertext systems are not up to the task: a true dialogue requires a conversational participant who is able to take account of the content of the dialogue so far, and to respond appropriately in context. Existing systems are, by and large, providers of pre{written, canned material. By using natural language generation techniques, however, we can tailor the system's contributions to take account of the ongoing discourse context. In this paper, we look at how natural language generation techniques can be used to enhance the coherence of the system's turns in the conversation. We demonstrate the ideas by reference to two Web-based language generation systems we have constructed, the peba-ii system and the ilex system.", "journalVolume": "", "journalName": "", "year": 1997, "title": "The Web as Dialogue: the role of natural language generation in hypertext", "venue": "", "journalPages": "", "authors": [{"ids": ["1721330"], "name": "Robert Daley"}, {"ids": [], "name": "Maria Milosavljevicyand"}, {"ids": [], "name": "Jon Oberlanderz"}], "inCitations": [], "keyPhrases": ["Coherence", "Hypertext", "Natural Language Generation", "Conversation", "Dialogue"], "id": "007e16923acdaff7e292a04ef8896e2e847ba7e4"}, {"outCitations": ["062e29ef0af63a19887315287c5c16d7882dddb3", "7946878d6291bbfca8167373a711496ec8bbd163", "1686afe36575fac65068c737aed218d73be12d09", "b854c36c9191b65d51db5f98a8a0dbed7caca978", "d7f6d2db2b3a42e068f1aa2e1b435afb866994b7", "25e07f4f48a28128cdb4a4fc44fce69a4ac3bf4d", "ddaa70de859cc90057c5c5d02ec3c7cfb765a075", "d6988778a5e89e7d9b0e5117f49f90f2b4508cb0", "c0a926070c81e67c02d4d1f81e9f4c1df832da82", "92a062bbb434f6a43ad3ee084d411f1db6b51129", "da819692de16b0e4491dd8c2c5d13bb92a744900", "0462a217c454ea7f72cffa4dd474ce04ee970fe7", "24a063572b742116591359876d3d4d6fd12a0c72", "7302bc3e94d7fcf836880e5b9fb229cae8976bae", "c4298aec2478396123eacb8a22547040f189846e", "0b16425bfa6316cfd77e80b07544732922d14ab1", "ff0f63bc27ae45e831912b69038105f713ce339d", "403cb2712a3cad02e4852239a216289a3878c51a", "856205e91343a24dbfdde579831413f71ecaf3e8", "8578d795e79d5a464215db37b15537a800d7cb48", "6a656293f5be8c19e2290996238e1a922bde7bd9", "24f1e55f4feaa3ce1904e521ef64346a57ec8c28", "375a865c879492f3b8d94d3512ed9d99d74c4620", "180951110b6188d496224492384b145be99f0a23", "43c67cc8998d068113168af17b4f4556a43e3489", "a40a4957f1bb44599b8fe760b38e67f09fc1e34b", "170fab490073c39a17b459db35f0f4ba627728de", "6eb29f75368cfbdfb7de22d273961cddafb69db2", "0e52569d904781eefc8a84204387757f0c202c05", "5ab8281e94f069341d7e95cedca763ea301583e3", "172da1feb615d6cda8e4b35e2835367c40536124", "040850ffab1a46744f4b99ff9837d0a9605a0adf", "6fa4be7a7115cc85683e63be266ef447cae1586b", "4580ba914fe16fae7d733b96e37a282bed953437", "330d538ab8bfcb0d00be8a6d3f6f96ea281b0319", "8602f5f14c34bf8ec84a6ba5e7f31546f158f9d6", "4fd1a5093c05892a718074d9fe5cbd461545291f", "3768829089e62f45579a05e6aa56b29292c97336", "eb9779d13db6999372b1f022cb84b02c860b65f2", "386aac68addef38f130083a846055b4bb0e7b82b", "e62f26ed5eed9a7e981b67e1e83f9d2edafca317", "7382a4d5fa12fe75474114f7bfd2edd4605c3951", "827f02fa52d0ec49a0abde6b8695f6035cb5c98f", "0eda8fdd7e47c5bee377cc404c161b2a9c3765a1", "d1af3b2e05c1c5b8aba91df823037d702cf17ae5", "ce6d78df6a7e2d31c0518a6a9702ba3afc81c930", "7e901d15dbd0953e42416d2c124da551c2ec2855", "2703b13f4f0cafefa592af2cd3ba27511f72f887", "ecc94ff877c445c3dce67f9fb74d65f4d1e2e15d", "9fe00c05d9caedee64ef706518cfaf03cab862ed", "910c34dae6a71549063d44899a7bc01693d9454a", "b6dad6fe86408540ef02afa7c157a0ca5bf22924", "ffa4489337f67c4b0400f70ff5a8a8eda1c81991", "7334166923d404aff2601fb900952f7299cc654b", "376ece1e6b6528148de6ac85b8d46f7ed997b0a8", "75433bc80d709f64ac5863affc74f53893a64948", "256af7bbf3819fa745e183f70594bf732815bb06", "7fde97c016df16a231f6f46a4872c56c36ec52a8", "4ccdbee96197513400aea9816e4748cac8772f26"], "pdfUrls": [], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/007ee4e71d6d477397e5c22e30935510ece49ee3", "paperAbstract": "Notch signaling pathway represents a principal cellular communication system that plays a pivotal role during development of metazoans.

The question addressed was whether the use of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is effective in reducing post-thoracotomy pain. Of the 74 papers found with a report search, nine prospective randomized controlled trials (RCT), among which three were double-blind, presented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. All investigated the effect of TENS as an adjunct therapy for relieving acute post-thoracotomy pain in patients undergoing thoracic surgery. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, study type, group studied, relevant outcomes and results of these papers are given. We conclude that a vast majority - seven of the nine retrieved studies - were in favor of TENS as an adjuvant to narcotic analgesics for improving outcome after thoracic surgery. Indeed, the interest and benefit has been shown not only in the treatment of acute post-thoracotomy pain (pain scores and narcotic requirements were consistently lower in the TENS group as opposed to the Placebo-TENS group), but also when used together with narcotic analgesics to reduce the duration of recovery room stay and to increase chest physical tolerance (better coughing attempts during chest physiotherapy) with positive effects on pulmonary ventilator function [forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) and/or forced vital capacity (FVC)]. Specifically, the TENS treatment was shown to be ineffective when used alone in severe post-thoracotomy pain (i.e. posterolateral thoracotomy incision), but useful as an adjunct to other medications in moderate post-thoracotomy pain (i.e. muscle sparing thoracotomy incision) and very effective as the sole pain-control treatment in patients experiencing mild post-thoracotomy pain (i.e. video-assisted thoracoscopy incision). Hence, current evidence shows TENS associated with postoperative medications to be safe and effective in alleviating postoperative pain and in improving patient recovery, thus enhancing the choice of available medical care and bettering outcome after thoracic surgery.", "journalVolume": "10 2", "journalName": "Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery", "year": 2010, "title": "Is transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation effective in relieving postoperative pain after thoracotomy?", "venue": "Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery", "journalPages": "283-8", "authors": [{"ids": ["13345541"], "name": "Anne Freynet"}, {"ids": ["4619301"], "name": "Pierre-Emmanuel Falcoz"}], "inCitations": ["048dd85da96537cddf2f1d3d318c7d0fc763c807", "fda7c09778c5551a331fb9a8e4cf3e596fb72163", "08abf4e48bb8e08c07ddbba3bd0c3ce121e3f68e", "78474b4855f538ce12bbdca730a3aeec1f78e571", "549c39860338b52c1a3636935622fd08147df6ef", "dcfd412d11e7e834076506762656a737396dc428", "112614674acd29f77e4402b3961b4724d7b921a1", "e62910b801a4215a987a92cf3fbdcf2ff30833cf", "81b6a2718871466b606a257f6d6f0c1f61ee26d7", "944da8206cb8b39a37c0947fde227d7c2a2b824f", "b8941e6c0797a9fb87647c3259afecc4a0febcb6", "905662a45c7acc69d769f01181c99839cb897f08", "3254a832a6f42ea6369e1478de7c14e5574a6a81"], "keyPhrases": [], "id": "00805f0206c6d03e2d8ee3ff8d33368e14b39647"}, {"outCitations": [], "pdfUrls": [], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00809034c0bf81e4163c81b683252ea3d54529a4", "paperAbstract": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalName": "", "title": "Self-Localization of Asynchronous Wireless Nodes With Parameter Uncertainties", "venue": "", "journalPages": "", "authors": [], "inCitations": [], "keyPhrases": [], "id": "00809034c0bf81e4163c81b683252ea3d54529a4"}, {"outCitations": [], "pdfUrls": ["http://ebmh.bmj.com/content/ebmental/7/1/14.full.pdf"], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0081099e98fc975df23a5f4e524dffa382afa725", "paperAbstract": "Leucht S, Barnes TRE, Kissling W, et al.

Liquid ethanol, propanol, butanol, hexanol, and octanol are simulated at pressure P = 1 bar and temperatures T = 300 K, T = 350 K, and T = 400 K. The fractions of molecules with different sets of hydrogen bonded partners, the size of associated cluster and the site-site distribution functions between atoms participating on hydrogen bonding are extracted from simulated trajectories. For all alcohols longer than ethanol, the length of the alkyl chain has only a marginal effect on the association. Consequently, related properties like coordination numbers of hydroxyl group, size distribution of associates, or fractions of differently coordinated alcohol molecules are independent on the molecular size. Although we employed a force-field without involved polarizability, we observe a positive cooperativity of hydrogen bonding simply as a consequence of steric and electrostatic interactions. The size and topology of associates is analyzed within the frame of 3B model of statistical association fluid theory. Although this approach enables good thermodynamic description of systems containing associating compounds, several insufficiencies appear in the description at molecular level.", "journalVolume": "139 17", "journalName": "The Journal of chemical physics", "year": 2013, "title": "Size distribution of associated clusters in liquid alcohols: interpretation of simulation results in the frame of SAFT approach.", "venue": "The Journal of chemical physics", "journalPages": "174502", "authors": [{"ids": ["4290839"], "name": "Ji\u0159\u00ed Jane\u010dek"}, {"ids": ["10173010"], "name": "Patrice Paricaud"}], "inCitations": [], "keyPhrases": [], "id": "00811bc1e817d40036e3a2b89d23a9b99a14a929"}, {"outCitations": [], "pdfUrls": [], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00812fcd66f0954102704a3cb6b5c6969a755b9b", "paperAbstract": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalName": "", "title": "Modulation of NO Bioavailability by Temporal Variation of the Cell-Free Layer Width in Small Arterioles", "venue": "", "journalPages": "", "authors": [], "inCitations": [], "keyPhrases": [], "id": "00812fcd66f0954102704a3cb6b5c6969a755b9b"}, {"outCitations": [], "pdfUrls": [], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00813ee5aa9b1d47d576497d1bfb902c7001371b", "paperAbstract": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalName": "", "title": "Enhanced Incorporation of 3-Hydroxy-4-Methylvalerate Unit into Biosynthetic Polyhydroxyalkanoate Using Leucine as a Precursor", "venue": "", "journalPages": "", "authors": [], "inCitations": [], "keyPhrases": [], "id": "00813ee5aa9b1d47d576497d1bfb902c7001371b"}, {"outCitations": [], "pdfUrls": [], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00821d11acc7937bd49bb60826933bcca2d02187", "paperAbstract": "Nonmotor symptoms (NMS) are increasingly recognized as a significant cause of morbidity in later stages of Parkinson's disease (PD). Prodromal NMS are also a well recognized component of the clinical picture in some patients but the prevalence of NMS as presenting complaints, and their impact on clinical management, in pathologically-proven cases of PD is unknown. The presenting complaints of 433 cases of pathologically-proven PD archived at the Queen Square Brain Bank for Neurological Diseases were identified from the clinical case notes. 91/433 (21%) of patients with PD presented with NMS of which the most frequent were pain (15%), urinary dysfunction (3.9%), anxiety, or depression (2.5%). Presenting with NMS is associated with a delayed diagnosis of PD (Mann-Whitney U, P = 0.001). These patients were more likely to be misdiagnosed initially and were more likely to have been referred to orthopedic surgeons or rheumatologists than neurologists (nonmotor group 5.5% vs. motor group 44.2%, chi(2) P < 0.0001). NMS are commonly seen as presenting complaints in pathologically confirmed PD, and initial misdiagnosis may be associated with potentially inappropriate medical interventions. Presenting with NMS does not affect the motor response to medication, but is associated with shorter disease duration (chi(2) P = 0.016).", "journalVolume": "23 1", "journalName": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "year": 2008, "title": "Nonmotor symptoms as presenting complaints in Parkinson's disease: a clinicopathological study.", "venue": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "journalPages": "101-6", "authors": [{"ids": ["4440684"], "name": "Sean Stephen O'Sullivan"}, {"ids": ["21102095"], "name": "David D.

Cows that calved with body condition score greater than or equal to 3.50 did not differ in average daily milk production, cumulative 80-day milk yield, or 305-day milk yield, compared with cows that calved with body condition score less than 3.50. Cows that calved with body condition score greater than or equal to 3.50 lost more condition than did cows that calved with body condition score less than 3.50. Body condition score at calving and amount of body condition loss interacted with the rate of change in daily milk production. Serum urea nitrogen concentration did not differ for cows grouped by cumulative 80-day milk production or for cows grouped by amount of condition loss.

The demand side analysis is based on a contingent valuation study on people's willingness to pay for emergency treatment, transportation services and disaster relief activities. The supply side is identified by a high percentage of volunteers in the Red Cross organization which makes the provision of emergency help at low cost possible. We find that aggregate benefits of Red Cross services exceed their cost of production. Policy conclusions are drawn with respect to future recruitment and funding: whereas intrinsic motivation is important for the decision to volunteer, and financial incentives play a minor role in general, the young Red Cross activists work voluntarily for self-realization reasons and to continue their education.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying the down-regulation of WT1 by curcumin is not completely delineated. The purpose of this present study is to identify a new miRNA-mediated mechanism which plays an important role in the anti-proliferation effects of curcumin in leukemic cells.\n\n\nMETHODS\nK562 and HL-60 cells were treated with different concentrations of curcumin for 24 and 48 hours, the level of miR-15a/16-1 and WT1 were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. WT1 expression and cell proliferation were detected by Western blotting and CCK-8, after curcumin treated-K562 and HL-60 cells were transfected with anti-miR-15a/16-1 oligonucleotides.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe found that pure curcumin upregulated the expression of miR-15a/16-1 and downregulated the expression of WT1 in leukemic cells and primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Overexpression of miR-15a/16-1 deduced the protein level of WT1 in leukemic cells, but downregulation of WT1 by siRNA-WT1 could not increase the expression of miR-15a/16-1 in leukemic cells. These results reveal that curcumin induced-upregulation of miR-15a/16-1 is an early event upstream to downregulation of WT1. Furthermore, anti-miR-15a/16-1 oligonucleotides (AMO) partly reversed the downregulation of WT1 induced by pure curcumin in leukemic cells and AMO promoted the growth of curcumin treated-K562 and HL-60 cells.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThus, these data suggest for the first time that pure curcumin downregulated the expression of WT1 partly by upregulating the expression of miR-15a/16-1 in leukemic cells. miR-15a/16-1 mediated WT1 downregulation plays an important role in the anti-proliferation effect of curcumin in leukemic cells.", "journalVolume": "31", "journalName": "", "year": 2012, "title": "Pure curcumin decreases the expression of WT1 by upregulation of miR-15a and miR-16-1 in leukemic cells", "venue": "Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR", "journalPages": "27 - 27", "authors": [{"ids": ["4732395"], "name": "Shen-meng Gao"}, {"ids": ["7788114"], "name": "Jun-Jun Yang"}, {"ids": ["5590580"], "name": "Chi-qi Chen"}, {"ids": ["5486189"], "name": "Junjie Chen"}, {"ids": ["8544653"], "name": "Li-Ping Ye"}, {"ids": ["15068688"], "name": "Lu-yao Wang"}, {"ids": ["3945104"], "name": "Jian-bo Wu"}, {"ids": ["4770207"], "name": "Chong-yun Xing"}, {"ids": ["2580400"], "name": "Kang Yu"}], "inCitations": ["784a7491754783aeee0f19617542e821ed8b3d55", "3ad60b1e3d4ad67de0cd9cd2a49755eaa54e4d20", "e388866e9a25fc04d554a1505952cbfd971cf6f7", "fb13ed98aa71967d101354cab385db1636b6cf9a", "21a28d40df1cad14fc5a48372bf4351a5053ee57", "7fd0c9532098e5feb36f6185dd9715e8386cd160", "129eeeba5e6b6ebf91de182909ac0330783e489f", "8f3df2a77c675c26bbe544b38dcb32898b739f86", "9673e522314a4c606d1139b4b0546e46ea85725e", "672a0983eab3d110c979c9ec20a9404193b302f4", "2d39e8eaa9ee06a83c6508b9317c66cbd17855a4", "ee529477074b15c8066fc9ccbfc8a656e8796286", "e57658a05568b318d89152954b84124dd77a6845", "33b0b5a4f4424764776f2191d3ee5f2be533bb08", "c01156f866b5a8b4b95707c2ceb01b8f39bf6795", "28dafc33f655e18d4ed23655d768eb655c42afe6"], "keyPhrases": ["Curcumin", "MiR-15a/16-1", "Leukemic Cell", "HL-60", "Leukemia"], "id": "0085d58b04ed64eb52cb3359529454e214c5213e"}, {"outCitations": [], "pdfUrls": [], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0085f7ecd46852022822fcd46b23125bd310eb4d", "paperAbstract": "Molecular apocrine is a subtype of estrogen receptor-negative (ER.) breast cancer, which is characterized by a steroid-response gene signature that includes androgen receptor, FOXA1, and a high frequency of ErbB2 overexpression. In this study, we demonstrate that there is a strong association between the overexpression of FOXA1 and ErbB2 in ER- breast tumors. This has led us to identify a cross-regulation network between FOXA1 and ErbB2 signaling in ER- breast cancer. We present two mechanisms to explain the association between FOXA1 and ErbB2 overexpression in molecular apocrine cells. In one process, ErbB2 signaling genes CREB1 and c-Fos regulate FOXA1 transcription, and in another process, AP2\u03b1 regulates the expression of both FOXA1 and ErbB2. Moreover, we demonstrate that FOXA1, in turn, regulates the transcription of ErbB2 signaling genes. This includes a core gene signature that is shared across two molecular apocrine cell lines. Importantly, the most upregulated (RELB) and downregulated (PAK1) genes in this signature are direct FOXA1 targets. Our data suggest that FOXA1 acts as a dual-function transcription factor and the repressive function of FOXA1 on RELB can be explained by the recruitment of its binding partner corepressor TLE3. It is notable that a group of FOXA1-regulated genes vary across molecular apocrine cell lines leading to the differences in the functional effects of FOXA1 on extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation and cell viability between these lines. This study demonstrates that there is a cross-regulation network between FOXA1 and ErbB2 signaling that connects FOXA1 to some of the key signaling pathways in ER-breast cancer.", "journalVolume": "14 4", "journalName": "Neoplasia", "year": 2012, "title": "Cross-regulation between FOXA1 and ErbB2 signaling in estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer.", "venue": "Neoplasia", "journalPages": "283-96", "authors": [{"ids": ["2889979"], "name": "Ali Naderi"}, {"ids": ["18182345"], "name": "Michelle R Meyer"}, {"ids": ["5612113"], "name": "Dennis H.

Based on correlations between audiometric measures of aged patients and histologic findings garnered from postmortem examinations, four types of presbycusis have been characterized: sensory-neural, neural, strial, and conductive [Schuknecht, H.F., Gacek, M.R., 1993. Ann. Otol. Rhinol. Laryngol. 102, 1--16]. Otopathologic changes to the inner ear as a direct function of age, however, remain controversial. The focus of this investigation involves the pathological impact on remaining sensory structures in patients having sensory--neural degeneration. The current study presents seven human temporal bones extracted from patients aged 53--67 years with high-tone hearing loss and with no known history of extraordinary environmental events involving head or noise trauma, acoustic overstimulation, or ototoxicity. In previously published findings of these specimens, all but one temporal bone failed to demonstrate a meaningful correlation between audiometric measurements and loss of functional hair cell populations with secondary retrograde degeneration of nerve fibers. Using the block surface method, electron microscopic micrographs demonstrate ultrastructural changes in the cuticular plate, stereocilia, pillar cells, stria vascularis, and the spiral ligament. In all pathological specimens, the greatest incidence of degeneration was seen at the cuticular plate. Conclusively, our findings present three implications in the aging human cochlea: firstly, audiometric measures that represent a high-tone hearing loss may take various forms with respect to ultrastructural patterns of degeneration and surviving structures; secondly, the incidence of lipofuscin and lysosome granules does not correlate with the degree of hearing loss and; thirdly, as shown only in guinea pigs [Anniko, M., 1988. Scanning Microsc. 2, 1035--1041], high-tone hearing loss can be associated with deformation of the cuticular plate.", "journalVolume": "157 1-2", "journalName": "Hearing research", "year": 2001,

Americas, whereas type 2 (HTLV-2) is widely distributed among the indigenous peoples of the Americas, where it appears to be more prevalent than HTLV-1, and in some tribes of Central Africa. HTLV-2 is considered ancestral in the Americas and is transmitted to the general population and injection drug users from the indigenous population. In the Americas, HTLV-1 has more than one origin, being brought by immigrants in the Paleolithic period through the Bering Strait, through slave trade during the colonial period, and through Japanese immigration from the early 20th century, whereas HTLV-2 was only brought by immigrants through the Bering Strait. The endemicity of HTLV-2 among the indigenous people of Brazil makes the Brazilian Amazon the largest endemic area in the world for its occurrence. A review of HTLV-1 in all Brazilian tribes supports the African origin of HTLV-1 in Brazil. The risk of hyperendemicity in these epidemiologically closed populations and transmission to other populations reinforces the importance of public health interventions for HTLV control, including the recognition of the infection among reportable diseases and events.", "journalVolume": "57", "journalName": "", "year": 2015, "title": "Origin and Prevalence of Human T-lymphotropic Virus Type 1 (htlv-1) and Type 2 (htlv-2) among Indigenous Populations in the Americas", "venue": "Revista do Instituto de Medicina Tropical de Sa\u0303o Paulo", "journalPages": "1 - 14", "authors": [{"ids": ["4902667"], "name": "Arthur Paiva"}, {"ids": ["4777448"], "name": "Jorge Casseb"}], "inCitations": ["064f40e9b9f58a9ca0561af1f54ad0c5bc86c61a", "bf319ff06608e923faba6ab0764e6345e8b6d0f5", "5734b3fa84d4b83653caff1ced96c8ee1c82909d", "d9e6b3bb6635d0486f35dab9e426a24ba8ae74d0", "0cde7297ee85e2cbd38496080e459737843de70d"], "keyPhrases": ["HTLV", "Htlv-1", "HTLV-2", "Tribe", "Indigenous People"], "id": "0087d040a2f0ed3e21c90038edd3cbe13f9a4a23"}, {"outCitations": ["eb13342f7ccfb02e4ddfc167d41c56224cfaec81", "11d4a47bd27bd668035a17f8a16f893fdf161c80", "5b63a252273d70a87e58e4300c4bed1ff91b167d", "9970a526e85cd4878e14ad59e07d3bcad24a2ec2", "904211813c74b7f5725327f3bf4c0e551affa7b9", "9a1e41d4bbb12e1bfe53869a0d1f3a7286bdcce4", "42651fadb7ec88e2421ae6a4a498f0036ca06719", "f6bed77ca99ade8a78cc14dcbf63a5ac456d6824", "df94e5b5f3974f34dff434558d5bbd58291b7010", "ec2538e7d1a998b5f9bbba6742cebcb0f291b8fd", "dec96771bef961bfd94ce332ad3f958e16c27b03", "108eb011c081aab674084613e2bdad28ff96cd7a", "dde2111d34f44301d06c73f2bd104e04720e303d", "ede4910c0ad407ea7b05640f3f429b1fad81274d", "2ab603a0b26de4518482ee85b0223f4950732ea7", "81615cae0ee0244c551a8b7f0cb54135793834b4", "2e6809eb1ef37332fe552c6d822be21e10d826a4", "5a43e9b546a2106282449d08027e18a0545ee0b5", "994bd6d50da75b8bf3783a665f9cd965ce2d0371", "7121213f1d56e42de529138f58ed7cc63fb5f095", "a3d2f12bb86fe3d0a689384fd5332acc0e298575", "2720378b49c3653489dddbe0c28086f636824f4e", "db02d57f4c66eac5f5d49999b871665fc095c698", "2ce504c1fd6c4d73f53050c8b4721383b132f4a8", "4df0d26166760b0ede4367aade76bf3d8a51018b", "e65b4dc05ae93c44845637592036ac9e2acd3783", "492f83e5b70ae3ba034442684d1b5fb9fc3518a8", "86e51bb60834ba722e7f095150bdc7f8b26f0e20", "28488f219410838271e09adfbad7da499d97e9bc", "ab0fa555a1d678c2fcdcf6df457f744859e60ded", "c6bb1aae3a451258da0c4f6893c5282262b50ebe", "1952f268149c24e05bc5064103b69c7ffe7446cb", "2c34eafa8d3529550c037e994ae272bfca22e873", "c7ab0581ee7d64c758b404f3b8f639121ae321c2", "a6857c6793dbfde7878a7babfab56bef34f1250e", "88bbe9c9494fdcf38ca8aad2299d963bb3a65cbc", "63847b8b7437872c2be8f3d71e9f75449494a52c", "1434ffafa877c10fbb9250050c3e42a2bf812288", "2352bd290a650b10c6a98a410a16885b9380e744"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.jimmunol.org/content/jimmunol/176/12/7482.full.pdf"], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0087ff57b7d6bb3126a6831d3947337877fa7fea", "paperAbstract": "Tapasin (tpn), an essential component of the MHC class I (MHC I) loading complex, has a canonical double lysine motif acting as a retrieval signal, which mediates retrograde transport of escaped endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins from the Golgi back to the ER. In this study, we mutated tpn with a substitution of the double lysine motif to double alanine (GFP-tpn-aa). This mutation abolished interaction with the coatomer protein complex I coatomer and resulted in accumulation of GFP-tpn-aa in the Golgi compartment, suggesting that the double lysine is important for the retrograde transport of tpn from late secretory compartments to the ER. In association with the increased Golgi distribution, the amount of MHC I exported from the ER to the surface was increased in 721.220 cells transfected with GFP-tpn-aa. However, the expressed MHC I were less stable and had increased turnover rate.

However, unvalidated self-reports of cigarette smoking may bias true estimates of relative risk of smoking-related health outcomes. This report is based on two separate investigations. First, within a molecular epidemiologic study of the relationship between environmental exposures (smoking, air pollution, diet) and developmental impairment, we have compared self-reported tobacco smoke exposure during pregnancy to plasma cotinine measurements in mothers. One hundred and fifty-eight patients from obstetrical wards in Cracow and in Limanowa, Poland were included in the parent study. Biochemically-identified smokers were defined as persons with plasma cotinine levels greater than 25 ng/mL. The data showed that exposure classification based on self-reported smoking status compared with cotinine values was of low sensitivity (52%) but of high specificity (98%). We assessed the effect of this exposure classification error on the association between low birth weight (LBW) and smoking in pregnancy using data from a related epidemiologic study of children's health in Cracow involving 1115 subjects. The odds ratio (OR) estimates for smoking and LBW after adjustment for exposure misclassification error were significantly higher than before adjustment (crude OR = 2.9, corrected OR = 5.1). The estimated attributable fraction (AF(pop)) based on the crude OR amounted to 22%; however, after adjustment it reached 50%. The corresponding values for the attributable fraction in the exposed group (AF(exp)) were 66% and 80%. These results illustrate the value of validating questionnaire responses on smoking during pregnancy against reliable biologic markers.", "journalVolume": "8 3", "journalName": "Journal of exposure analysis and environmental epidemiology", "year": 1998, "title": "Exposure misclassification error in studies on prenatal effects of tobacco smoking in pregnancy and the birth weight of children.", "venue": "Journal of exposure analysis and environmental epidemiology", "journalPages": "347-57", "authors": [{"ids": ["3972589"], "name": "Wies\u0142aw A.

One of these genes, the chicken mim-1 gene, is activated by Myb exclusively in myelomonocytic cells and, therefore, has been an interesting model system to study how Myb activates a target in a lineage-specific manner. Previous work has suggested that Myb activates mim-1 by cooperating with CCAAT box/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta) or other C/EBP transcription factors at the mim-1 promoter. We have now identified and characterized a powerful Myb-dependent enhancer located 2 kb upstream of the mim-1 promoter. The enhancer is preferentially active in myelomonocytic cells, confers Myb responsiveness onto a heterologous promoter, and dramatically increases Myb responsiveness of the mim-1 promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrates that v-Myb and C/EBPbeta are bound to the enhancer in v-Myb-transformed cells; furthermore, cooperation of the enhancer with the mim-1 promoter is greatly stimulated by C/EBPbeta and p300. Taken together, our results show that the regulation of mim-1 expression by v-Myb is more complex than previously assumed and involves two distinct regions of the mim-1 gene. A major function of v-Myb (in addition to its role at the mim-1 promoter) apparently is to activate the mim-1 enhancer and, together with C/EBPbeta and p300, facilitate its cooperation with the promoter. Interestingly, our work also shows that the v-Myb protein encoded by avian myeloblastosis virus is defective in this function, suggesting an explanation for why primary avian myeloblastosis virus-transformed myeloblasts do not express the mim-1 gene.", "journalVolume": "25 1", "journalName": "Molecular and cellular biology", "year": 2005, "title": "v-Myb mediates cooperation of a cell-specific enhancer with the mim-1 promoter.", "venue": "Molecular and cellular biology", "journalPages": "499-511", "authors": [{"ids": ["5085276"], "name": "Olesya Chayka"}, {"ids": ["8959631"], "name": "J\u00f6rg Kintscher"}, {"ids": ["6756583"], "name": "Daniel Braas"}, {"ids": ["12301484"], "name": "Karl-Heinz Klempnauer"}], "inCitations": ["19f84a0b8d86470de8fa27b0deaa41fb68870aae", "d9a9dc754a38b0f1729cf7fcda0725b3ac1d6b1a", "b44c27becf69d439930f591d490a714d4f0575ec", "a92977b3f31aa41a725f1a4235d845160849fabf", "1b549aa89cf7ec3d66c28d2aa650479ba4a49fc4", "755f5daea011d22733e0a974ffe67635c933078b", "31d85a57aa56b616bd6e4d5196bb56bc9e5be5a3", "06a36e5836354042f8d4f61fd0958228804c5611", "0ea8328889a0c2afb3173279a6f496e4a8e624cd", "657d5ede9baed061ddda214bfeab77dd8fcef7c2", "bb6f2c3317d2f0ab5905d822c8b72cb8b650509a", "7ad4eccba0f36f15e748fd16310f8dd2aacf285d", "776b29d3051c81c2271e365ec520a149ea0174a5", "241c487f95ea7a22958e33ec5ed5373db5eea65f"], "keyPhrases": [], "id": "00886fa39b81100a95c0dd8044c6ae6a50d5fa76"}, {"outCitations": [], "pdfUrls": [], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0088f653eb8b885d7e1436dbb035bc59568cef7c", "paperAbstract": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalName": "", "title": "Bacterial sepsis after extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) of calyceal diverticular stone", "venue": "", "journalPages": "", "authors": [], "inCitations": [], "keyPhrases": [], "id": "0088f653eb8b885d7e1436dbb035bc59568cef7c"}, {"outCitations": [], "pdfUrls": [], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0089af97e74f9777156f55598da6f1177f8c041f", "paperAbstract": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalName": "", "title": "Reproductive ability of pastel sables", "venue": "", "journalPages": "", "authors": [], "inCitations": [], "keyPhrases": [], "id": "0089af97e74f9777156f55598da6f1177f8c041f"}, {"outCitations": [], "pdfUrls": [], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/008a368443657b1ec5c238d93a3237483239c19c", "paperAbstract": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalName": "", "title": "The \u2018Vektoren-Navigations-Hypothese\u2019 its validity for different populations of the same species", "venue": "", "journalPages": "", "authors": [], "inCitations": [], "keyPhrases": [], "id": "008a368443657b1ec5c238d93a3237483239c19c"}, {"outCitations": ["11aedb8f95a007363017dae311fc525f67bd7876", "c285b9c52f3bf261e219eff8d6e3edb59a3a1a8f", "ec2c6b676b6a39e007a06207784a19a0f16ad05e", "396aabd694da04cdb846cb724ca9f866f345cbd5", "19499542913e261151d61e7175eac5e035b7f614", "3d07b5087e53c6f7c228b3c7e769494527be228e", "7c27562748cb9e7b970f516c0eb89e11986dcc4b", "10aed904c19cda603a7b493af44960771ab2ea14", "084c271f21fa917c39d2dbf06a093cd787179305", "7fa51d9ebf688949571a86411c7baf13d30c74d0", "1aff792035e15ece53f05bbda6ceb5fe4359fe8d", "0cfcb2eb0134bb4bad8477745a872733bbd2b940", "022f600ff683d0b5158dac85832b8aecd00fe86f", "0bc50d75597b99999634d909009153673deff56d", "0a0dba86c980d4ba5f881aea0239fa689084e6c5", "6e88be1f8dac507e4299d83724b8247014378a69", "98aa7cfc9b1efd016fb6da4e684f027d9fef6f15", "0482eeefa01c4cbf585f572c1fd4ed930ee222d2"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.statmt.org/wmt14/pdf/W14-3359.pdf", "http://aclweb.org/anthology/W14-3359", "http://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/~antho/W/W14/W14-3359.pdf", "https://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/publications/download/920/MansourSaabNeyHermann--UnsupervisedAdaptationforStatisticalMachineTranslation--2014.pdf", "http://www.mt-archive.info/10/WMT-2014-Mansour.pdf", "http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W14-3359.pdf", "https://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/publications/download/920/Mansour-WMT%202014-2014.pdf", "http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W/W14/W14-3359.pdf", "http://aclweb.org/anthology//W/W14/W14-3359.pdf", "http://aclweb.org/anthology/W/W14/W14-3359.pdf", "http://anthology.aclweb.org/W/W14/W14-3359.pdf"], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/008ab94ef5cfef25e7bd3670655af6b474cfdcf2", "paperAbstract": "In this work, we tackle the problem of language and translation models domainadaptation without explicit bilingual indomain training data.

This report evaluates previously described alternative indices of insulin sensitivity with the goal of identifying a reliable, but logistically simpler, alternative.\n\n\nMETHODS\nData from 1460 participants in the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS) were used to assess the proportion of the relationship between a recognized measure of insulin sensitivity (Bergman's SI) and cardiovascular risk factors that is contained in each of nine alternative measures.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA number of the alternative indices contained a substantial proportion of the information available in Bergman's SI. The Galvin's index and the homeostasis model were most promising. However, there remained a significant amount of the information in Bergman's SI that was not contained in any of the alternative indices.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nThere are simpler alternative indices of insulin sensitivity for use in epidemiological studies, but each alternative is associated with some loss of information. It may be possible that this loss can be overcome with an increased sample size; however, using the alternative indices may also confound the assessment of insulin sensitivity with other underlying factors (i.e., hyperinsulinemia). The alternative indices are not recommended for the clinical assessment of insulin sensitivity for an individual patient or subject.", "journalVolume": "8 6", "journalName": "Annals of epidemiology", "year": 1998, "title": "Ability of alternative indices of insulin sensitivity to predict cardiovascular risk: comparison with the \"minimal model\".

Sequence similarity between exons and introns is analysed and embedded into the gene structure scaffold. The visualization on the SVC server provides detailed information about evolutionarily conserved features of these genes. It further allows concise representation of complex splice patterns in the context of evolutionary conservation.

Patient demographics, catheter location, dwell time, and indication for removal were recorded. Pull-back contrast venography was performed with imaging over the chest. Catheters were then removed or exchanged.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThree hundred thirty-four tunneled dialysis catheters were removed or exchanged in 207 patients; 108 male, median age 53 years. Dwell time, available from 296 catheters, ranged from 1 to 114 days (median, 66 days) for a total of 32,847 catheter days. One hundred three catheters were removed for infection, yielding a rate of infection requiring catheter removal of 3.0 per 1,000 catheter days. One hundred catheters were removed for other working access, and 96 catheters were exchanged for poor function. Two hundred sixty-five were removed or exchanged from the internal jugular vein, 22 from the subclavian vein, and 24 from the femoral vein. One hundred seventy-two (76%) of the 226 catheters studied with contrast had fibrin sheaths; of which 42 had thrombus identified along the catheter tract. One hundred ninety-three catheters were removed, and 141 catheters were exchanged for new catheters with 82 catheters receiving balloon disruption of the fibrin sheath.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nApproximately one third of tunneled dialysis catheters are removed for infection, one third for other working access, and one third for poor function. Catheters usually remain in the patient for a median of 2 months. Fibrin sheaths associated with hemodialysis catheters are very common.

An important data mining task is to find interesting groups of objects that form clusters in subspaces of the data sources jointly supported by those data sources. In this paper, we study a novel problem of mining mutual subspace clusters from multiple sources. We develop two interesting models and the corresponding methods for mutual subspace clustering. The density-based model identifies dense regions in subspaces as clusters. The bottom-up method searches for density-based mutual subspace clusters systematically from low-dimensional subspaces to high-dimensional ones. The partitioning model divides points in a data set into k exclusive clusters and a signature subspace is found for each cluster, where k is the number of clusters desired by a user. The top-down method interleaves the well-known k-means clustering procedures in multiple sources. We use experimental results on synthetic data sets and real data sets to report the effectiveness and the efficiency of the methods. & 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, human leptin was produced and secreted efficiently in Escherichia coli using a novel Bacillus sp. endoxylanase signal peptide. The endoxylanase signal sequence consisted of 28 amino acids (84 bp) was fused to the leptin structural gene. The fused gene was expressed using an inducible promoter (T7 or Trc) by adding 1 mM IPTG. Using T7 promoter in E. coli BL21(DE3), most of protein produced was in a premature form. Using the Trc promoter, which is weaker than T7, leptin was efficiently produced and secreted as a mature form (40% of total proteins) at 37 degrees C. However, most of leptin (about 90%) formed the inclusion bodies in the periplasmic space of E. coli. At 30 degrees C, ca. 90% of leptin was produced in a soluble form, but the total amount of leptin produced was 40% less than that obtained at 37 degrees C. When the periplasmic oxidoreductase of E. coli, DsbA, was co-expressed, 69% of the secreted leptin (26% of total proteins) was produced as soluble form at 37 degrees C without the decrease of the amount of leptin produced.", "journalVolume": "67 4", "journalName": "Biotechnology and bioengineering", "year": 2000, "title": "Secretory production of human leptin in Escherichia coli.", "venue": "Biotechnology and bioengineering", "journalPages": "398-407", "authors": [{"ids": ["8071833"], "name": "Kang Jin Jeong"}, {"ids": ["1684142"], "name": "S Lee"}], "inCitations": ["7de0c7ba36d65f100f05a54515675e57b3f5120b", "2afde5aea660df033111826ff7c2c24750bb1d49", "9f64ec4eab03677d7ee46020567129ee8fbade2d", "fb89bb5f34f7e2dc799f7032aaca227bc1d414ed", "34c441118af495f273c17132e9eca55d3174c57b", "a7ab12b0328f945c48d10066ed330f9a31f48ca2", "f85847d581a0565b37a41e69ea45adf9ed1d1757", "207483c2a27b8ecf6a6069123c8a516640bc6c7e", "143c17e670417ac0020655dc58d91ff1e20b82f5", "4813a70082089e7fe32760e69d5dddfc6f156e7c", "cefbe1d87ca8d28ce2010aa3c3ad86dd5ca887de", "525320bf79b5b2150f6e2820238f7dea278b9ba3", "7c0a15a70be63f9707358fb640e01b464e54dfd0", "cceb6a96e0b2408a0a257053a97506f6a58e6cd3", "5fb82630a2bc93ecbfb22142e9ee01edf16d0d82", "b2cdd4bb79cd7f043fbff5a30ef7c53943598c28", "f8ad0d2f4e66ba77b6f993746cff91bef60dd0c1"], "keyPhrases": [], "id": "00913d947e60cef3b4771c18f66518e47c62bf0a"}, {"outCitations": [], "pdfUrls": [], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00914f442487985ddeda1b3363f01c0e0118feaa", "paperAbstract": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalName": "", "title": "GMM-HMM acoustic model training by a two level procedure with Gaussian components determined by automatic model selection", "venue": "", "journalPages": "", "authors": [], "inCitations": [], "keyPhrases": [], "id": "00914f442487985ddeda1b3363f01c0e0118feaa"}, {"outCitations": ["24235fb3a26d8748ac971d3c6deb3601c9d3880e", "47aaa3ba7d1dfee497726ee2d7f0165e072816c6"], "pdfUrls": ["http://gsp.tamu.edu/Publications/epistemology-papers/causality-randomness-intelligibility-and-the-epistemology-of-the-cell/files/cg_cell.pdf", "http://gsp.tamu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2017/05/CG-11-221.pdf", "ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/ea/bd/Curr_Genomics_2010_Jun_11(4)_221-237.tar.gz"], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0092a97a45ca9dcc8601f61dac181ef3add5afd7", "paperAbstract": "Because the basic unit of biology is the cell, biological knowledge is rooted in the epistemology of the cell, and because life is the salient characteristic of the cell, its epistemology must be centered on its livingness, not its constituent components. The organization and regulation of these components in the pursuit of life constitute the fundamental nature of the cell. Thus, regulation sits at the heart of biological knowledge of the cell and the extraordinary complexity of this regulation conditions the kind of knowledge that can be obtained, in particular, the representation and intelligibility of that knowledge. This paper is essentially split into two parts. The first part discusses the inadequacy of everyday intelligibility and intuition in science and the consequent need for scientific theories to be expressed mathematically without appeal to commonsense categories of understanding, such as causality. Having set the backdrop, the second part addresses biological knowledge. It briefly reviews modern scientific epistemology from a general perspective and then turns to the epistemology of the cell. In analogy with a multi-faceted factory, the cell utilizes a highly parallel distributed control system to maintain its organization and regulate its dynamical operation in the face of both internal and external changes. Hence, scientific knowledge is constituted by the mathematics of stochastic dynamical systems, which model the overall relational structure of the cell and how these structures evolve over time, stochasticity being a consequence of the need to ignore a large number of factors while modeling relatively few in an extremely complex environment.", "journalVolume": "11", "journalName": "", "year": 2010, "title": "Causality, Randomness, Intelligibility, and the Epistemology of the Cell", "venue": "Current genomics", "journalPages": "221 - 237", "authors": [{"ids": ["1693776"], "name": "Edward R.

Costs were assigned according to standards of care in Western Australia (WA). Cancer risks and the efficacy of surveillance on long-term outcomes were derived from the published literature.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe cost-effectiveness of genetic testing was compared in first-degree relatives of known mutation carriers who have a 50% risk of carrying the mutated gene (intervention group) to individuals with the same risk but who do not undergo a genetic test (control subjects).

The mode of feeding and admissions for pneumonia/choking were analyzed. Baseline clinical and demographic variables were compared between feeding groups. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to estimate time to pneumonia/choking. Clinical variables significantly associated with pneumonia/choking free survival were identified using Cox regression.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHospitalisation for pneumonia/choking occurred in 89 out of 194 patients, with the highest admission rate in rejected enteral feeding group (66.7%), followed by enteral feeding (61.8%) and oral feeding (38.8%) groups. The estimates of median time to event were 11, 14, and 47 months for rejected enteral feeding, enteral and oral feeding groups respectively (log-rank test p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The rejected enteral feeding group had the highest risk of pneumonia/choking (HR 4.61, 95%CI:2.33-9.08, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), followed by enteral feeding group (HR 2.29, 95%CI:1.25-4.19, p\u00a0=\u00a00.007), when compared to oral feeding group after adjusting for possible confounders. A stepwise Cox regression showed that the rejected enteral feeding (HR 4.89, 95%CI:2.19-10.88, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), enteral mode of feeding (HR 2.43, 95%CI:1.11-5.32, p\u00a0=\u00a00.026), and Charlson weighted index of co-morbidity (HR 1.27, 95%CI:1.03-1.58, p\u00a0=\u00a00.028) were independently associated with higher hazard of pneumonia/choking.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCompliance to feeding recommendations is important to reduce the risk of hospitalisation for pneumonia/choking.

NA inhibited Ca(2+)-evoked exocytosis by reducing the number of exocytotic events, without modifying vesicle size. Fusion pore properties also were unaffected. NA-induced inhibition of exocytosis was abolished by a high level of Ca(2+) influx, by intracellular application of antibodies against the G protein subunit G\u03b2 and was mimicked by the myristoylated \u03b2\u03b3-binding/activating peptide mSIRK. NA-induced inhibition was also abolished by treatment with BoNT/A, which cleaves the C-terminal nine amino acids of SNAP-25, and also by a SNAP-25 C-terminal-blocking peptide containing the BoNT/A cleavage site. These data indicate that inhibition of exocytosis by NA is downstream of increased [Ca(2+)](i) and is mediated by an interaction between G\u03b2\u03b3 and the C-terminus of SNAP-25, as is the case for inhibition of neurotransmitter release. Remarkably, in the course of this work, a novel effect of NA was discovered. NA induced a marked retardation of the rate of refilling of the readily releasable pool (RRP) of secretory granules. This retardation was specifically abolished by a G\u03b1(i1/2) blocking peptide demonstrating that the effect is mediated via activation of G\u03b1(i1) and/or G\u03b1(i2).", "journalVolume": "588 Pt 18", "journalName": "The Journal of physiology", "year": 2010, "title": "Noradrenaline inhibits exocytosis via the G protein \u03b2\u03b3 subunit and refilling of the readily releasable granule pool via the \u03b1(i1/2) subunit.", "venue": "The Journal of physiology", "journalPages": "3485-98", "authors": [{"ids": ["26716101"], "name": "Ying Zhao"}, {"ids": ["4726458"], "name": "Qinghua Fang"}, {"ids": ["4502272"], "name": "Susanne G.

To date, nine apomucins (MUC1-8, and MUC5B) have been identified. Recent studies have demonstrated that MUC1 is expressed in tumors of various human organs, and may function as an anti-adhesion molecule that inhibits cell-to-cell adhesion, inducing tumor metastasis. MUC2 is a major secreted mucin of colon and is known to be expressed in cells showing intestinal metaplasia in the stomach and other organs. MUC2 expression in the mucosal epithelia is an apparently abnormal phenomenon related to the neoplastic process. In this study, we examined MUC1 and MUC2 expression in human gallbladder adenocarcinoma and its clinicopathological significance and relationship with the prognosis of the patients. MUC1 immunoreactivity was detected not only in the cancer cells but also in the cancer stroma. Cytoplasmic MUC1 expression was significantly relation to lymphatic invasion and lymph node metastasis (p < 0.001), and was associated with a poor outcome. In contrast, MUC2 was rarely expressed in gallbladder carcinomas, and its immunoreactivity was detected only in the cancer goblet cells. Overexpression of MUC2 was not significantly related to lymphatic invasion or lymph node metastasis, or prognosis of patients. These observations suggested that MUC1 expression plays a more important role than MUC2 expression in cancer cell growth and metastasis of human gallbladder adenocarcinomas.", "journalVolume": "8 3", "journalName": "Oncology reports", "year": 2001, "title": "MUC1 and MUC2 expression in human gallbladder carcinoma: a clinicopathological study and relationship with prognosis.", "venue": "Oncology reports", "journalPages": "485-9", "authors": [{"ids": ["13337554"], "name": "Hironobu Kashiwagi"}, {"ids": ["2484365"], "name": "Hiroshi Kijima"}, {"ids": ["4572115"], "name": "Shoichi Dowaki"}, {"ids": ["3503787"], "name": "Yoshimasa Ohtani"}, {"ids": ["6215807"], "name": "Kosuke Tobita"}, {"ids": ["2324585"], "name": "Hitoshi Yamazaki"}, {"ids": ["1880827"], "name": "Mitsutoshi Nakamura"}, {"ids": ["7318246"], "name": "Yoshito Ueyama"}, {"ids": ["1752907"], "name": "Mark M.

Reorganizations and downsizing with increased workload imply stress for health-care professionals. This is a study of burnout in nurses during a period with two comprehensive reorganizations.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this quasi-experimental retrospective cohort study, burnout was assessed in nurses with long work experience in three surveys during a 30 months' period with two comprehensive reorganizations and downsizing of a hospital unit with mostly seriously ill patients with cancer. Burnout was measured with Bergen Burnout Indicator (BBI) at each survey, and \"Sense of Coherence\" (SOC) with Antonovsky's questionnaire at the last survey.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOne man and 45 women aged 30 to 65 years were invited to the surveys. There was a significant increase in burnout during the study period, the mean increase in BBI-score was 12.5 pr year (p < 0.001). The proportion of satisfied nurses at the first and last survey were 84% and 35% respectively, and the proportions with burnout were 0% and 29% respectively (p < 0.001). Except for auxiliary nurses with experience from the medical department, all subgroups experienced a significant increase in BBI. Burnout was associated with low SOC (p < 0.001, r square 0.33).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere was a significant development of burnout in a group of nurses during a period with two reorganizations and downsizing. Burnout was associated with low SOC.

To reevaluate LDA frequencies, we developed a flow cytometry test for direct determination of alloreactive T-cell frequencies and compared these frequencies with classical LDA estimates of frequencies.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFor determination of frequencies by flow cytometry, peripheral blood lymphocytes (or lymphocytes taken from primary mixed lymphocyte culture) were stimulated with either Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines or T cell-depleted spleen cells and stained for intracellular interferon (IFN)-gamma production and CD69. In lung transplant recipients, frequencies of IFN+ alloreactive T cells were compared with LDA frequencies, that is, cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursors and helper T lymphocyte precursors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWith flow cytometry, alloreactive T cells were detected after overnight allostimulation as IFN-gamma CD69bright cells (range, 0.1-0.58% and 0.1-0.66% of total CD4 and CD8 cells, respectively). Frequencies increased 25-fold or more when lymphocytes were prestimulated in primary mixed lymphocyte culture before testing. After lung transplantation, mean donor-specific IFN+ CD8 T-cell frequencies did not decrease as mean donor-specific LDA cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursor frequencies, whereas no difference was seen in pretransplantation samples or third-party-specific frequencies at both time points. Mean frequencies of IFN+ CD4 did not differ from helper T lymphocyte precursors at both time points, but frequencies did not correlate.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe flow cytometry test allows a direct measurement of alloreactive T-cell frequencies and demonstrates a discrepancy between donor-specific IFN+ CD8 T-cell frequencies and LDA CLTp after transplantation.

This is due in part to the issue of selection: if families who choose parental care are different from those who opt for non-parental care, the observed association between outcomes and care may not be causal. We address this using four strategies: controlling for a wide array of observable characteristics (including lagged outcomes), using propensity score matching, estimating unobservables bias by looking at selection on observables, and instrumenting use of care with supply-side or demand-side shocks. We find that non-parental care is associated with worse behavioural outcomes, but that the magnitude of the difference is quite small. Moreover, we cannot reject the hypothesis that our effects are solely due to selection. To the extent that we observe differential impacts, the association between non-parental care and behavioural outcomes appears to be more negative in high-SES families, and less negative in day care centres with smaller group sizes (though again, these relationships may not be causal).", "journalVolume": "", "journalName": "", "year": 1998, "title": "Which Children Benefit From Non-Parental Care?", "venue": "", "journalPages": "", "authors": [{"ids": ["3435809"], "name": "Andrew Leigh"}, {"ids": ["25502071"], "name": "Chikako Yamauchi"}], "inCitations": ["adfa8899b2989610ae9e0dce6b3da61464f54ee5", "fe816e3ff6ed9be65608e9aacd1bae996b4a0d43"], "keyPhrases": [], "id": "009bf156d251b9262edaa4fa793091225e843dc4"}, {"outCitations": ["6ca78b53b66660cf64bb1157adf0945894233f54", "702861d3877f1d9bb82c49859436ce024b7efac6", "d9515ee0c43f3b03f0b38b75e31dab4432823a64", "f93d56de108716f05e754d441db05d580b674ea1", "df690f440e5c0a690e128090fd996f2e72cb72da", "fc563d8eefa80246cbd2f5bf796931794a8d6e2d", "ed5f0c9aa9b5153bd59d11faf1eb4b8ea5c5446b", "6d48350a8190f8ed29454c70f7a9f269a5097894", "01e16a3e038e5bfcdb11ffb1dfca1979a042d245", "82568d08b262483c8c2575dc3da992bd1d275c15", "e0ecb1a1673a6376b8432e8528d148b7f1255a61", "808a1ab8c4cbfa3486e235152a537890a926a9d8", "8679acffa7bbe5d8da83b23a2fa427ec2c11975a", "c12f809df62d9565163265b5cbcfe8acb3b0ec39", "7669f98c51abf7c667951d1ef10ad0679e53521f", "8448a16bbf499a96bab376796280d0081dff2324", "d9bd56c2d0464481182cc441e6370225644a6abf", "2fbc4f5986170ab050e48f72ef9fa4214f9de7ee", "2005152bb99dbec13f62a59aafe0918d172f0e53", "5387850577e49274820a29e2cf728a806af48a15"], "pdfUrls": ["http://jvi.asm.org/content/78/9/4951.full.pdf", "http://jvi.asm.org/content/77/22/12184.full.pdf"], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/009cfd7f9005eb0bd4bf0f31ed8cf6450a209b68", "paperAbstract": "Molecular events and the interdependence of the two rotavirus nonstructural proteins, NSP5 and NSP2, in producing viroplasm-like structures (VLS) were previously evaluated by using transient cellular coexpression of the genes for the two proteins, and VLS domains as well as the NSP2-binding region of NSP5 were mapped in the context of NSP2. Review of the previous studies led us to postulate that NSP2 binding of NSP5 may block the N terminus of NSP5 or render it inaccessible and that any similar N-terminal blockage may render NSP5 alone capable of producing VLS independent of NSP2. This possibility was addressed in this report by using two forms of NSP5-green fluorescent protein (GFP) chimeras wherein GFP is fused at either the N or the C terminus of NSP5 (GFP-NSP5 and NSP5-GFP) and evaluating their VLS-forming capability (by light and electron microscopy) and phosphorylation and multimerization potential independent of NSP2. Our results demonstrate that NSP5 alone can form VLS when the N terminus is blocked by fusion with a nonrotavirus protein (GFP-NSP5) but the C terminus is unmodified. Only GFP-NSP5 was able to undergo hyperphosphorylation and multimerization with the native form of NSP5, emphasizing the importance of an unmodified C terminus for these events. Deletion analysis of NSP5 mapped the essential signals for VLS formation to the C terminus and clearly suggested that hyperphosphorylation of NSP5 is not required for VLS formation. The present study emphasizes in general that when fusion proteins are used for functional studies, constructs that represent fusions at both the N and the C termini of the protein should be evaluated.", "journalVolume": "77 22", "journalName": "Journal of virology", "year": 2003, "title": "The N- and C-terminal regions of rotavirus NSP5 are the critical determinants for the formation of viroplasm-like structures independent of NSP2.", "venue": "Journal of virology", "journalPages": "12184-92", "authors": [{"ids": ["4735569"], "name": "K.

Previous studies have suggested that the presence of alternate redox cycles is responsible for the inhibition of activity seen in the high-substrate regime. Here, we demonstrate that partitioning between these redox cycles (termed the 0/2 and 1/3 cycles on the basis of the number of reducing equivalents present in the oxidized/reduced enzyme encountered in each cycle) is dependent on both TMA and electron acceptor concentration. The use of Fc(+) as electron acceptor has enabled a study of the major redox forms of TMADH present during steady-state turnover at different concentrations of substrate. Reduction of Fc(+) is found to occur via the 4Fe-4S center of TMADH and not the 6-S-cysteinyl flavin mononucleotide: the direction of electron flow is thus analogous to the route of electron transfer to the physiological electron acceptor, an electron-transferring flavoprotein (ETF). In steady-state reactions with Fc(+) as electron acceptor, partitioning between the 0/2 and 1/3 redox cycles is dependent on the concentration of the electron acceptor. In the high-concentration regime, inhibition is less pronounced, consistent with the predicted effects on the proposed branching kinetic scheme. Photodiode array analysis of the absorption spectrum of TMADH during steady-state turnover at high TMA concentrations reveals that one-electron reduced TMADH-possessing the anionic flavin semiquinone-is the predominant species. Conversely, at low concentrations of TMA, the enzyme is predominantly in the oxidized form during steady-state turnover. The data, together with evidence derived from enzyme-monitored turnover experiments performed at different concentrations of TMA, establish the operation of the branched kinetic scheme in steady-state reactions. With dimethylbutylamine (DMButA) as substrate, the partitioning between the 0/2 and 1/3 redox cycles is poised more toward the 0/2 cycle at all DMButA concentrations studied-an observation that is consistent with the inability of DMButA to act as an effective inhibitor of TMADH.", "journalVolume": "38 45", "journalName": "Biochemistry", "year": 1999, "title": "Redox cycles in trimethylamine dehydrogenase and mechanism of substrate inhibition.", "venue": "Biochemistry", "journalPages": "14927-40", "authors": [{"ids": ["26318973"], "name": "Pendaran Roberts"}, {"ids": ["6447558"], "name": "Jaswir Basran"}, {"ids": ["11000687"], "name": "Emma K.

The clinical characteristics, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis were analyzed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll 12 patients were women with median age of 50 years (44-76 years). The patients all presented a single mass in the breast on presentation. The diameter ranged from 2.5 cm to 10.0 cm in diameter. All of the patients had undergone surgical resection. There were 6 cases in stage IIa, 2 in IIb, 2 in IIIa and 2 in IIIb according to the TNM staging system of AJCC and UICC.

By the drug repositioning strategy, we confirmed that perhexiline maleate (Pex) potentially ameliorates heterotopic ossification in model cells and mice. Here, we conducted a prospective study to assess the efficacy and safety of Pex in the treatment of FOP patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFOP patients in this open-label single-center study were treated with Pex for a total of 12 months, and followed up for 12 consecutive months after medication discontinuation. The safety of the treatment was assessed regularly by physical and blood examinations. The efficacy of Pex for preventing heterotopic ossifications was evaluated by the presence of flare-ups, measurements of serum bone markers, and changes in the total bone volume calculated by the three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) images.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFive patients with an average age of 23.4 years were enrolled. Within safe doses of Pex administration in each individual, there were no drug-induced adverse effects during the medication phase. Three patients showed no intense inflammatory reactions during the study period, while two patients had acute flare-ups around the hip joint without evidence of trauma during the medication phase. In addition, one of them became progressively incapable of opening her mouth over the discontinuation phase. Serum levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and bone specific ALP (BAP) were significantly and synchronously increased with the occurrence of flare-ups. Volumetric 3D-CT analysis demonstrated a significant increase in the total bone volume of Case 2 (378 cm(3)) and Case 3 (833 cm(3)) during the two-year study period.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe could not prove the efficacy of oral Pex administration in the prevention of heterotopic ossifications in FOP. Serum levels of ALP and BAP appear to be promising biomarkers for monitoring the development of ectopic ossifications and efficacy of the therapy. Quantification of change in the total bone volume by whole body CT scanning could be a reliable evaluation tool for disease progression in forthcoming clinical trials of FOP.", "journalVolume": "8", "journalName": "", "year": 2013, "title": "Perhexiline maleate in the treatment of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva: an open-labeled clinical trial", "venue": "Orphanet journal of rare diseases", "journalPages": "163 - 163", "authors": [{"ids": ["4000605"], "name": "Hiroshi Kitoh"}, {"ids": ["5529228"], "name": "Masataka Achiwa"}, {"ids": ["2298173"], "name": "Hiroshi Kaneko"}, {"ids": ["7137207"], "name": "Kenichi Mishima"}, {"ids": ["6177403"], "name": "Masaki Matsushita"}, {"ids": ["5366971"], "name": "Izumi Kadono"}, {"ids": ["3649786"], "name": "John David Horowitz"}, {"ids": ["3953009"], "name": "Benedetta C.

Using geometrical and topological approximations we calculate the volumes of ureters and renal pelvises, applying in vivo measurements obtained from conventional ultrasound, retrograde cystourethrograms and topographic anatomic references. Approximations use 2 decimals and assumed \u03c0 value was 3.14. Ureteral and pyelic volumes are calculated, respectively, from the mathematical formula for the cylinder and cone volumes. Dolicomegaureter are compensated using proportional calculi. Bladder volumes are estimated from conventional formulae. Proximal urinary sequestration is compared between infants and older children with VUR. Mechanisms of direct induction of bladder urodynamic failure from VUR are suggested. Sequestration of urine in the ureter and renal pelvis can be estimated from mathematical formulae in patients with VUR. The values used derive from ultrasound examinations, CUM and topographical anatomical references. Primary VUR can determine urodynamic problems.

Recent demonstrations that .O2- inactivates the potent vasodilator endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) and that EDRF is probably nitric oxide (NO) suggest that EDRF(NO) may act as an endogenous free radical scavenger. This hypothesis was tested in an in vitro system by analyzing the effect of authentic NO (dilutions of a saturated aqueous solution) on .O2- production (detected spectrophotometrically as reduction of cytochrome c) by fMet-Leu-Phe-activated human leukocytes (PMN). NO depressed the rate of reduction of cytochrome c by .O2- released from PMN's or generated from the oxidation of hypoxanthine by xanthine oxidase. This effect was concentration-dependent and occurred at dilutions of the saturated NO solution (1:250 to 1:10) which inhibited platelet aggregation. NO had no direct effect on cytochrome c or on xanthine oxidase. These observations indicate that NO(EDRF) can be regarded as a scavenger of superoxide anion and they suggest that EDRF(NO) may provide a chemical barrier to cytotoxic free radicals (.O2-).", "journalVolume": "181 3", "journalName": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "year": 1991, "title": "Cytoprotective function of nitric oxide: inactivation of superoxide radicals produced by human leukocytes.", "venue": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "journalPages": "1392-7", "authors": [{"ids": ["3505809"], "name": "Gabor M.

Personality can play a central role in social behaviour both in dyadic interactions and in social networks. We investigated whether explorative behaviour, as proxy of personality of territorial male great tits (Parus major), predicts their own and their neighbours' territorial responses towards simulated intruders. Several weeks prior to playback, subjects were taken from the wild to test their exploratory behaviour in a standard context in the laboratory. Exploratory behaviour provides a proxy of personality along a slow-fast explorer continuum. Upon release, males were radio-tracked and subsequently exposed to interactive playback simulating a more or a less aggressive territorial intruder (by either overlapping or alternating broadcast songs with the subjects' songs). At the same time, we radio-tracked a neighbour of the playback subject. Male vocal responses during playback and spatial movements after playback varied according to male explorative behaviour and playback treatment. Males with lower exploration scores approached the loudspeaker less, and sang more songs, shorter songs and songs with slower element rates than did males with higher exploration scores. Moreover, neighbour responses were related to the explorative behaviour of the subject receiving the playback but not to their own explorative behaviour.

Our results suggest that respiratory and/or circulatory regulation of cases with SIDS is disturbed by reduction of CGRP expression, because CGRP is well known to be a vasodilator, a neurotransmitter and a promoter for proliferation of epithelium in airways.", "journalVolume": "52 1", "journalName": "Nihon ho\u0304igaku zasshi = The Japanese journal of legal medicine", "year": 1998, "title": "[Immunohistochemical study on pulmonary neuroendocrine cells containing calcitonin gene-related peptide in sudden infant death syndrome].", "venue": "Nihon ho\u0304igaku zasshi = The Japanese journal of legal medicine", "journalPages": "27-36", "authors": [{"ids": ["3701529"], "name": "Naoya Sakamoto"}, {"ids": ["6141526"], "name": "Mikio Doi"}, {"ids": ["3485400"], "name": "Noriyoshi Ohashi"}, {"ids": ["2054133"], "name": "Sonoko Misawa"}], "inCitations": [], "keyPhrases": [], "id": "00a95c3a0b2819b2dc2585ea0db106ae5d3535af"}, {"outCitations": [], "pdfUrls": [], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/00aa01ab990baa99915aab7f8cb24fc715935aa8", "paperAbstract": "Today's bioanalytical CROs face increasing global competition, highly variable demand, high fixed costs, pricing pressure, and increasing demand for quality and speed. Most bioanalytical laboratories have responded to these challenges by implementing automation and by implementing process improvement methodologies (e.g., Six Sigma). These solutions have not resulted in a significant improvement in productivity and profitability since none of them are able to predict the upturn or downturn in demand. High volatility of demand causes long lead times and high costs during peak demand and poor productivity during trough demand. Most bioanalytical laboratories lack the tools to align supply efficiently to meet changing demand. In this paper, sales and operation planning (S&OP) has been investigated as a tool to balance supply and demand. The S&OP process, when executed effectively, can be the single greatest determinant of profitability for a bioanalytical business.", "journalVolume": "5 14", "journalName": "Bioanalysis", "year":
